    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;SALISBURY AND THE LAW
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N this year of our
      Lord's grace, 1787, the ancient town of Salisbury, seat of justice for
      Rowan County, and the buzzing metropolis of its region, numbers by word of
      a partisan citizenry eight hundred souls. Its streets are unpaved, and
      present an unbroken expanse of red North Carolina clay from one narrow
      plank sidewalk to another. In the summer, if the weather be dry, the red
      clay resolves itself into blinding brick-red dust. In the spring, when the
      rains fall, it lapses into brick-red mud, and the Salisbury streets become
      bottomless morasses, the despair of travelers. Just now, it being a bright
      October afternoon and a shower having paid the town a visit but an hour
      before, the streets offer no suggestion of either mud or dust, but are as
      clean and straight and beautiful as a good man's morals. Trees rank either
      side, and their branches interlock overhead. These make every street a
      cathedral aisle, groined and arched in leafy green.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the suburbs, that is to say about pistol shot from the town's
      commercial center, stands a two-story mansion. It is painted white, and
      thereby distinguished above its neighbors, and has a heavily columned
      veranda all across its wide face. This edifice is the residence of Spruce
      McCay, a foremost member of the Rowan County bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner of the lawn, which unfolds verdantly in front of the house, is
      a one-story one-room structure, the law office of Spruce McCay. Inside are
      two or three pine desks, much visited of knives in the past, and a
      half-dozen ramshackle chairs, which have seen stronger if not better days.
      Also there is a collection of shelves; and these latter hold scores of law
      books, among which &ldquo;Blackstone's Commentaries,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coke on Littleton,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Hales's Pleas of the Crown&rdquo; are given prominent place. The books show
      musty and dog-eared, and it is many years since the youngest among them
      came from the printing press.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this October afternoon, the office has but one occupant. He is tall,
      being six feet and an inch, and so slim and meager that he seems six
      inches taller. Besides, he stands as straight as a lance, with nothing of
      stoop to his narrow shoulders, and this has the effect of augmenting his
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face is a boy's face. It is likewise of the sort called &ldquo;horse&rdquo;; with
      hollow cheeks and lantern jaws. The forehead is high and narrow. The
      yellow hair is long, and tied in a cue with an eelskin&mdash;for eelskins
      are according to the latest fashionable command sent up from Charleston.
      The redeeming feature to the horse face is the eyes. These are big and
      blue and deep, and tell of a mighty power for either love or hate. They
      are Scotch-Irish eyes, loyal eyes, steadfast eyes, and of that inveterate
      breed which if aroused can outstare, outdomineer Satan.
    </p>
    <p>
      As adding to the horse face a look of command, which sets well with those
      blue eyes&mdash;so capable of tenderness and ferocity&mdash;is a high
      predatory nose. The mouth, thin-lipped and wide, is replete of what folk
      call character, but does nothing to soften a general expression which is
      nothing if not iron. And yet the last word is applicable only at times.
      The horse face never turns iron-hard unless danger presses, or perilous
      deeds are to be done. In easier, relaxed hours one finds no sternness
      there, but gayety and lightness and a love of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dress the horse-faced boy is rather the fop, with a bottle-green
      surtout of latest cut, high-collared, long-tailed, open to display a
      flowered waistcoat of as many hues as May, from which struggles a ruffle
      stiff with starch. The horsefaced boy has his predatory nose buried in a
      law book. This is as it should be, for he is a student of the learned
      Spruce McCay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There comes a step at the door; the horsefaced boy takes his nose from
      between the covers of the book. Spruce McCay walks in, and throws himself
      carelessly into a seat. He is a square, hearty man, with nose up-tilted
      and eager, as though somewhere in the distance it sniffed an orchard. He
      is of middle years, and well arrived at that highest ground, just where
      the pathway of life begins to slope downward toward the final yet still
      distant grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spruce McCay glances at a paper or two on his desk. Then, shoving all
      aside, he fills and lights a corn-cob pipe. Through the smoke rings he
      surveys the horse-faced boy; plainly he meditates a communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Andy, I've been thinking you over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andy says &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should cross the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blue eyes take on a bluer glint, and light up the horse face like
      azure lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a new country is the place for you. You are now about to be admitted
      to practice law; not because you know law, but for the reason that I have
      recommended it. As I say, you have little law knowledge; but you possess
      courage, brains, perseverance, honesty, prudence and divers other traits,
      which you take from your Carrickfergus ancestors. These should carry you
      farther in the wilderness than any knowledge of the books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The predatory nose snorts, and the horse face begins to glow resentfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I know no law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than does Necessity! Not enough to keep you from being laughed at
      in Rowan County! How should you? Your attention and your interest have
      both run away to other things. I've watched you for two years past. You
      are deep in the lore of cockfighting, but guiltless of the Commentaries of
      our worthy Master Blackstone. If I were to ask you for the Rule in
      Shelly's Case, you would be posed. At the same time you could expound
      every rule that governs a horse race. In brief you are accomplished in
      many gentlemanly things, while as barren of law learning as a Hottentot.
      Now if you were a lad of fortune, instead of being as poor as the crows,
      you might easily cut a figure of elegant idleness on the North Carolina
      circuits. But you lack utterly of that money required to gild and make
      tolerable your ignorance here at home. In the woods along the Cumberland,
      that is to say in the Nashville and Jonesboro courts, where ignorance and
      poverty are the rule, your deficiencies will count for trifles. Also you
      will be surrounded by conditions that promote courage, honesty and
      quickness to a first importance. On the Cumberland the fact that you are a
      dead shot with rifle or pistol, and can back the most unmanageable horse
      that ever looked through a bridle, will place you higher in the confidence
      of men than would all the law that Hobart, Hales and Hawkins ever knew.
      Now don't get angry. Think over what I've said; the longer you look at it,
      the more you'll feel that I am right. I'll see that you are given your
      sheepskin as a lawyer; and, when you decide to migrate, I'll have you
      commissioned in that new country as attorney for the state. This last will
      send you headlong into the midst of a backwoods practice, where those
      native virtues you own should find a field for their exercise, and your
      talents for cockfighting and horse racing, added to your absolute genius
      for firearms, be sure to advance you far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spruce McCay raps the ashes from his corncob pipe. Just then one of the
      house negroes taps at the door, as preliminary to intruding a respectful
      head. The respectful head announces that visitors have arrived at the big
      white mansion. Spruce McCay at this quits the office, and the horse-faced
      Andy finds himself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one hour he ponders the unpalatable words of his worthy master. His
      vanity has been hurt; his self-love ruffled. None the less he feels that a
      deal of truth lies tucked away in what Spruce McCay has said. Besides a
      plunge into the untried wilderness rather matches his taste, and a
      promised state's attorneyship is not to be despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the horse-faced Andy ruminates these things, laughter and much joyous
      clatter is heard at the door. This time it is his two fellow students,
      Crawford and McNairy. These young gentlemen have been out with their guns,
      and now present themselves with a double backload of quails as the fruits
      of it. The pair begin vociferously to inform the horse-faced Andy
      concerning their day's adventures. He halts the conversational flow with a
      repressive lift of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; says he, with a vast affectation of dignity, and as though
      sixty were the years of each instead of twenty, &ldquo;I desire your company at
      supper in my rooms. Come at 7 o'clock. I shall have news for you&mdash;news,
      and a proposition.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;THE ROWAN HOUSE SUPPER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE horse-faced
      Andy precedes the coming of his two friends to that supper by two hours.
      As he moves up the street toward the Rowan House, fair faces beam on him
      and fair hands wave him a salutation from certain Salisbury verandas. In
      return he doffs his hat with an exaggerated politeness, which becomes him
      as the acknowledged beau of the town. One cannot blame those beaming fair
      faces and those saluting hands. Slim, elegant, confident with a kind of
      polished cockyness that does not ill become his years, our horse-faced one
      possesses what the world calls &ldquo;presence.&rdquo; No one will look on him without
      being impressed; he is congenitally remarkable, and to see him once is to
      ever afterward expect to hear him. Besides, for all his foppishness, there
      is a scar on his sandy head, and a second on his hand, which were made by
      an English saber when he had no more than entered upon his teens. Also he
      has shed English blood to pay for those scars; and in a day which still
      heaves and tosses with the ground swells of the Revolution, such stark
      matters brevet one to the respect of men and the love of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foppish, horse-faced Andy strides into the Rowan House. In the
      long-room he meets mine host Brown, who has fame as a publican, and none
      as a sinner, throughout North Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper in my rooms, Mr. Brown,&rdquo; commands our hero; &ldquo;supper for three.
      Have it hot and ready at sharp seven. Also let us have plenty of whisky
      and tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mine host Brown says that all shall be as ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foppish Andy, with that grave manner of dignity which laughs at his
      boyish twenty years, explains to his landlord that he will call for his
      bill in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have my horse, Cherokee,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;well groomed and saddled. To-morrow I
      leave Salisbury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going West?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;West,&rdquo; returns Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the bill,&rdquo; ventures mine host Brown, &ldquo;would you like to play a game
      of all-fours, and make it double or nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andy the horse-faced hesitates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have such vile luck,&rdquo; he says, as though remonstrating with mine host
      Brown for a fault. &ldquo;It seems shameful to play with you, since you never
      win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mine host Brown looks sheepishly apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one as eager to play as I am,&rdquo; he responds, &ldquo;it does look as though I
      ought to know more about the game. However, since it's your last night, we
      might as well preserve a record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andy the horse-faced yields to the rabid anxiety of mine host Brown to
      gamble. The game shall be played presently; meanwhile, there is an errand
      which takes him to his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy goes to his rooms; mine host Brown, after preparing a table in the
      long-room for the promised game, saunters fatly&mdash;being rotund as a
      publican should be&mdash;into the kitchen, to leave directions concerning
      that triangular supper. There he encounters his wife, as rotund as
      himself, supervising the energies of a phalanx of black Amazons, who form
      the culinary forces of the Rowan House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Jackson leaves in the morning, mother,&rdquo; observes mine host Brown to
      Mrs. Brown, whom he always addresses as &ldquo;mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For good?&rdquo; asks Mrs. Brown, who is singeing the pin feathers from a
      chicken of much fatness, and exceeding yellow as to leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I knew he was going,&rdquo; returns mine host Brown, rather irrelevantly.
      &ldquo;Spruce Mc-Cay told me that he was about to advise him to emigrate to the
      western counties. Spruce says the Cumberland country is just the place for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I suppose,&rdquo; remarks Mrs. Brown, &ldquo;you'll let him win a good-by
      game of cards, to square his bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; returns mine host Brown. &ldquo;He's got no money; never had any
      money. You yourself said, when he came here, to give him his board free,
      because you knew and loved his dead mother. Now the Christian thing is to
      let him win it. In that way his pride is saved; at the same time it gives
      me amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Marmaduke,&rdquo; says Mrs. Brown, moving off with the yellow-legged
      fowl, &ldquo;I'm sure I don't care how you manage, only so you don't take his
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never was a chance, mother. He never has any money, after his
      clothes are bought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The game of all-fours is played; and is won by Andy of the horse face, who
      thereby rounds off a run of card-luck that has continued unbroken for two
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks as though I'd never beat you!&rdquo; exclaims mine host Brown,
      pretending sadness and imitating a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought never to gamble,&rdquo; advises the horse-faced Andy solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine host Brown produces his bill, wherein the charges for board, lodging,
      laundry, tobacco, and whisky in pints, quarts and gallons are set down on
      one side, to be balanced and acquitted by divers sums lost at all-fours,
      the same being noted opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are! All square!&rdquo; says mine host Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the charges for to-night's supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rdquo;&mdash;meaning Mrs. Brown&mdash;&ldquo;says the supper is to be with her
      compliments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steaming hot, the supper comes promptly at seven. It is followed, steaming
      hot, by unlimited whisky punch. Pipes are lighted, and, with glasses at
      easy hand, the three boys draw about the fire. The punch, the pipes, and
      the crackling log fire are very comfortable adjuncts on an October night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cries Crawford, who is full of life and interest, &ldquo;now for the
      news and the proposition!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McNairy nods owlish assent to the words of his volatile friend. He intends
      one day to be a judge, and, while quite as lively as Crawford, seizes on
      occasions such as this to practice his features in a formidable woolsack
      gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; observes Andy, soberly sipping his punch, &ldquo;let me put a question:
      What is my standing in Rowan County?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the recognized authority,&rdquo; cries Crawford, &ldquo;on dog fighting,
      cockfighting, and horse racing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McNairy nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; says Andy. Then, on the heels of a pause: &ldquo;And what should you
      say were my chief accomplishments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Crawford takes it upon himself to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ride, shoot, run, jump, wrestle, dance and make love beyond
      expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McNairy the judicial nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; says Andy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trio puff and sip in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say nothing for my knowledge of law?&rdquo; This from the disgruntled Andy,
      with a rising inflection that is like finding fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cry the others in hearty concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't believe us if we did,&rdquo; adds McNairy of the future woolsack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither would the Judge,&rdquo; returns Andy cynically. &ldquo;The Judge&rdquo; is the
      title by which the three designate their master, Spruce Mc-Cay. Andy goes
      on: &ldquo;The news I promised is this. To-morrow I leave Salisbury. The Judge
      has recommended my admission to the bar, and I shall take the oath and get
      my license before I start. I shall transfer myself to the region along the
      Cumberland, where I am told a barrister of my singular lack of ability
      should find plenty of practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you leave old Rowan?&rdquo; asks woolsack McNairy, beginning to take an
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have no education, less law, and still less money. It seems
      that these are conditions precedent to staying in Rowan with credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cries McNairy the judicial, grasping Andy's long bony hand, &ldquo;you
      have as much education, as much law, and as much money as I. Under the
      circumstances I shall go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; breaks in the lively Crawford, &ldquo;since I have none of those
      ignorant and poverty-eaten qualifications you name, but on the contrary am
      rich, wise and learned&mdash;I shall remain here. When the wilderness
      casts you fellows out, come back and I shall welcome you. Pending which&mdash;as
      Parson Hicks would say&mdash;receive my blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening wears on amid clouds of tobacco smoke and rivers of punch. At
      the close the three take hold of hands, and sing a farewell song very
      badly. Then, since they look on the evening as a sacred one, they wind up
      by breaking the pipes they have smoked and the glasses they have drunk
      from, to save them in the hereafter from profane and vulgar uses. At last,
      rather deviously, they make their various ways to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, young Andrew Jackson, barrister and counselor at law, with
      all his belongings&mdash;save the rifle he carries, and the pistols in his
      saddle holsters&mdash;crowded into a pair of saddlebags, rides out of
      Salisbury on his bay horse Cherokee. He will stop at Martinsville for a
      space, awaiting the judicial McNairy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the pair are to set their willing, hopeful faces for the Cumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Andy the horse-faced rides away that October afternoon, Henry Clay is a
      fatherless boy of nine, living with his mother at the Virginia Slashes;
      Daniel Webster, a sickly child of six, is toddling about his father's New
      Hampshire farm; John C. Calhoun is a baby four years old in a South
      Carolina farmhouse; John Quincy Adams, nineteen and just home from a
      polishing trip to France, is a Harvard student; Martin Van Buren, aged
      four, is playing about the tap room of his Dutch father's tavern at
      Kinder-hook; while Aaron Burr, fortunate, foremost and full of promise,
      has already won high station at the New York bar. None of these has ever
      heard of Andy the horse-faced, nor he of them; yet one and all they are
      fated to grow well acquainted with one another in the years to come, and
      before the curtain is rung finally down on that tragedy-comedy-farce
      which, played to benches ever full and ever empty, men call Existence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE BLOOMING RACHEL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ASHVILLE is the
      merest scrambling huddle of log houses. The most imposing edifice is a
      blockhouse, built of logs squared by the broadaxe. It is the home of the
      widow Donelson; and, since it is all her husband left her when the Indians
      shot him down at the plow-stilts, and because she must live, the widow
      Donelson has turned the blockhouse into a boarding house.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the widow Donelson dwells her daughter Rachel, a beautiful brunette
      of twenty, and the belle of the Cumberland. Rachel is vivacious and
      bright; and, while there is much confusion among her nouns, pronouns,
      verbs and adverbs in the matters of case, number, and tense, she shines
      forth an indomitable conversationist. With frontier freedom she laughs
      with everybody, jests with everybody, delights in everybody's admiration;
      and this does not please her husband, Lewis Robards, who is ignorant,
      suspicious, narrow, lazy, shiftless, jealous, and generally drunk. One
      time and another he has accused Rachel of a tenderness for every man in
      the settlement, and their quarrels have been frequent and fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evening; the widow Donelson is preparing supper for the half dozen
      boarders, assisted by the blooming Rachel. The moody Robards, half soaked
      in corn whisky, sits by the open door, ear on the conversation, eye on the
      not-over-distant woods. If the worthless Robards will not work, at least
      he may maintain a halfbright lookout for murderous Indians; and he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow Donelson glances across from the corn bread she is mixing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The runner who came on ahead,&rdquo; she says, addressing the blooming Rachel,
      &ldquo;reports the party as being due to-morrow. Mr. Jackson, the new State's
      Attorney, who will come with it, is to board and lodge with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blooming Rachel looks brightly up. The drunken Robards likewise looks
      up; but his face is gloomy with incipient jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Mr. Jackson, eh?&rdquo; he sneers. Then, to the blooming Rachel: &ldquo;It's mighty
      likely you'll find in him a new lover to try your wiles on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blooming Rachel colors and her black eyes snap, but she holds her
      tongue. The widow Donelson is also silent. The mother and daughter have
      found wordlessness the best return to those insults, which it is the habit
      of the jealous drunkard to hurl at his pretty wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runner made true report, and the party in which travels the
      horse-faced Andy makes its appearance next day. Tall, slender, elegant,
      self-possessed, and with a manner which marks him above the common, he is
      disliked by the drunken Robards on sight. When he declines to drink with
      that sot, the dislike crystallizes into hatred. The outrageous jealousy of
      Robards has found a new reason for its green-eyed existence, and he
      already goes drunkenly pondering the slaughter of the horse-faced Andy.
      Since he will never advance beyond the pondering stage, for certain
      reasons called &ldquo;craven&rdquo; among men of clean courage, his homicidal
      lucubrations are the less important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy the horse-faced does not notice Robards. He does, however, notice
      with a thrill of pleasure the beautiful Rachel, and is glad to find his
      lines are down in such pleasant places.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is vastly taken with the boarding house of the widow Donelson, and
      incautiously says as much. He praises her corn pone and fried squirrel,
      and vehemently avers that her hog and hominy are the best he ever ate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rachel the blooming does not allow her husband's jealousy to interrupt
      hospitality, and piles high the young State's Attorney's plate with these
      delicacies. She even brings out a store of wild honey and cream&mdash;dainties
      sparse and few and far between in these rude regions. She calls this
      &ldquo;hospitality&rdquo;; her jealous drunkard of a husband calls it &ldquo;making
      advances.&rdquo; He says that in the course of a long, and he might have added
      misspent, life, he has observed that a coquette, with designs on a man's
      heart, never fails to begin by making an ally of his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; says the drunken deductionist, &ldquo;that honey and cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night, after Rachel the blooming and her drunken husband retire, a
      bitter quarrel breaks out between them. It rages with such fury that the
      bicker arouses one Overton, who occupies the adjoining chamber. Mr.
      Overton is a severe character, firm and clear as to his rights. He objects
      to having his rest disturbed, alleging that he has troubles of his own.
      Taking final offense at the language of the brute Robards, which is more
      emphatic than nice, he gets his pistols. Rapping on the intervening wall
      to invoke attention, he informs that vituperative drunkard of his
      intention to instantly put him (Robards) to death, should he so much as
      raise his voice above a whisper for the balance of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rachel seeks her mother, and the jealous drunkard quiets down. He is not
      unacquainted with Mr. Overton, who is reputed to possess as restless a
      brace of hair triggers as ever owned flint and pan. Altogether he is
      precisely the one whose word would carry weight with such as Robards, and,
      on the back of his interference in the domestic affairs of that inebriate,
      a great peace settles upon the blockhouse of the widow Donelson which
      abides throughout the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the horse-faced State's Attorney, he knows nothing of the
      differences between Rachel and the jealous Robards. He does not sleep in
      the blockhouse, having been appointed to a blanket couch in the &ldquo;Bunk
      House,&rdquo; a separate dormitory structure which stands at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      During breakfast, the blooming Rachel again freights daintily deep the
      plate of the young State's Attorney. Thereupon the favored one beams his
      thanks, while behind his back as though to soothe his hate, the malevolent
      Rob-ards sits cleaning a rifle, casting upon him the while an occasional
      midnight look. Just across is the taciturn Overton, proprietor of those
      restless hair triggers, wondering over his bacon and eggs where this drama
      of love and threatened murder is to end.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;COLONEL WAIGHTSTILL AVERY OFFENDS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OW, when the
      horse-faced Andy finds himself in the Cumberland country, he begins to
      look about him. Being a lawyer, his instinct leads him to consider those
      opposing ranks of commerce, the debtor and creditor classes. He finds the
      former composed of persons of the highest honor. Also, their honor is
      sensitive and easily touched, being sensitive and touchy in proportion as
      the bulk of their debts is increased. The debtor class, as the same finds
      representation about those two Cumberland forums, Nashville and Jonesboro,
      holds it to be the privilege of every gentleman, when dunned, to challenge
      and if practicable kill his creditor honorably at ten paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      So firm indeed is the debtor class in this belief, that the creditor
      class, less warlike and with more to lose, seldom presents a bill. Neither
      does it refuse the opposition credit; for the debtor class also clings to
      the no less formidable theory, that to refuse credit is an insult quite as
      stinging as a dun direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the horse-faced Andy discovers the region to be a very Arcadia
      for debtors. Their credit is without a limit and their debts are never
      due. He resolves to disturb these commercial Arcadians; he will break upon
      them as a Satan of solvency come to trouble their debt paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse-faced Andy, as has been noted, is Scotch-Irish. Being Irish, his
      honor is as sensitive and his soul as warlike as are those of the most
      debt-eaten individual along the Cumberland. Being Scotch, he believes
      debts should be paid, and holds that a creditor may ask for his money
      without forfeiting life. He urges these views in tavern and street; and
      thereupon the creditors, taking heart, come to him with their claims. He
      accepts the trusts thus proffered; as a corollary, having now flown in the
      face of the militant debtor class, he is soon to prove his manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse-faced Andy files a declaration for a client, on a mixed claim
      based upon bacon, molasses and rum. The defendant, a personage yclept Irad
      Miller, genus debtor, species keel boatman, is a very patrician among
      bankrupts, boasting that he owes more and pays less than any man south of
      the Ohio river. Also, having been already offended by the foppish
      frivolity of that ruffled shirt and grass-green surtout, he is outraged
      now, when the ruffled grass-green one brings suit against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathing fire and smoke, the insulted Irad lowers his horns, and starts
      for the horse-faced Andy. His methods at this crisis are characteristic of
      the Cumberland; he merely grinds the horse-faced Andy's polished boot
      beneath his heel, mentioning casually the while that he himself is &ldquo;half
      hoss, half alligator,&rdquo; and can drink the Cumberland dry at a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is fighting talk, and the horse-faced Andy so accepts it. He surveys
      the truculent Irad with the cautious tail of his eye, and finds him
      discouragingly tall and broad and thick. The survey takes time, but the
      injured Irad prevents it being wasted by again grinding the polished toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andy the strategic suddenly seizes a rail from the nearby fence, and
      charges the indebted one. The end of the rail strikes that insolvent in
      what is vulgarly known as the pit of the stomach, and doubles him up like
      a two-foot rule. At that, he who is &ldquo;half hoss, half alligator,&rdquo; gives
      forth a screech of which an injured wild cat might be proud, and
      perceiving the rail poised for a second charge makes off. This small
      adventure gives the horse-faced Andy station, and an avalanche of claims
      pours in upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having established himself in the confidence of common men, it still
      remains with our horsefaced hero to conquer the esteem of the bar. The
      opportunity is not a day behind his collision with that violent one of
      equine-alligator genesis. In good sooth, it is an offshoot thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bruised Irad's case is up for trial. His counsel, Colonel Waightstill
      Avery, hails from a hamlet, called Morganton, on the thither side of the
      Blue Ridge. Colonel Waightstill is of middle age, pompous and high, and
      the youth of Andy&mdash;slim, lean, eager, horse face as hairless as an
      egg&mdash;offends him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor,&rdquo; cries Colonel Waightstill, addressing the bench, &ldquo;who, pray,
      is the opposing counsel?&rdquo; The boyish Andy stands up. &ldquo;Must I, your honor,&rdquo;
       continues the outraged Colonel Waightstill, &ldquo;must I cross forensic blades
      with a child? Have I journeyed all the long mountain miles from Morganton
      to try cases with babes and sucklings? Or perhaps, your honor&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Colonel Waightstill waxes sarcastic&mdash;&ldquo;I have mistaken the place.
      Possibly this is not a court, but a nursery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Waightstill sits down, and the horsefaced Andy, on the leaf of a
      law book, indites the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>August 12, 1788.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir: When a man's feelings and charector are injured he ought to seek
      speedy redress. My charector you have injured; and further you have
      Insulted me in the presunce of a court and a large aujence. I therefore
      call upon you as a gentleman to give me satisfaction for the same; I
      further call upon you to give me an answer immediately without
      Equivocation and I hope you can do without dinner until the business is
      done; for it is consistent with the character of a gentleman when he
      injures a man to make speedy reparation; therefore I hope you will not
      fail in meeting me this day.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>From yr Hbl st.,</i>

      The horse-faced one spells badly; but Marlborough did, Washington does and
      Napoleon will spell worse. It is a notable fact that conquering militant
      souls have ever been better with the sword than with the spelling book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge is a gentleman of quick and apprehensive eye, as frontier
      jurists must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, he is of finest sensibilities, and can appreciate the feelings of a
      man of honor. He sees the note shoved across to Colonel Waightstill by the
      horse-faced Andy, and at once orders a recess. The judge, with delicate
      tact, says the Cumberland bottoms are heavy with the seeds of fever, and
      that it is his practice to consume prudent rum and quinine at this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the judge goes for his rum and quinine, Colonel Waightstill and the
      horse-faced Andy repair to a convenient ravine at the rear of the log
      courthouse. A brother practitioner attends upon Colonel Waightstill, while
      the interests of the horse-faced Andy are conserved by Mr. Overton, who
      espouses his cause as a fellow boarder at the widow Donelson's. Mr.
      Overton has with him his invaluable hair triggers; and, since he wins the
      choice, presents them politely, butt first, to the second of Colonel
      Waightstill, who selects one for his principal. The ground is measured and
      pegged; the fight will be at ten paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Overton gives the horse-faced Andy his weapon, he asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you do at this distance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snuff a candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Let me offer a word of advice: Don't kill; don't even wound. The <i>casus
      belli</i> does not justify it, and you can establish your credit without.
      Should your adversary require a second shot, it will then be the other
      way. His failure to apologize, coupled with a demand for another shot,
      should mean his death warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse-faced Andy approves this counsel. And yet, if he must not wound
      he may warn, and to that admonitory end sends his ounce of lead so as to
      all but brush the ear of Colonel Waightstill. That gentleman's bullet
      flies safely wild. After the exchange of shots, the seconds hold a
      consultation. Mr. Overton says that his principal must receive an apology,
      or the duel shall proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Waightstill's second talks with that gentleman, and finds him much
      softened as to mood. The flying lead, brushing his ear like the wing of a
      death angel, has set him thinking. He now distrusts that simile of &ldquo;babes
      and sucklings,&rdquo; and is even ready to concede the intimation that the
      horse-faced Andy is a child to be far-fetched. Indeed, he has conceived a
      vast respect, almost an affection, for his youthful adversary, and will
      not only apologize, but declares that, for purposes of litigation, he
      shall hereafter regard the horse-faced Andy as a being of mature years.
      All this says Colonel Waight-still, under the respectful spell of that
      flying lead; and if not in these phrases, then in words to the same
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse-faced Andy shakes hands with Colonel Waightstill, and they
      return to the log courthouse, where the rum-and-quinine jurist is
      pleasantly awaiting them. The trial is again called, and the horse-faced
      Andy secures a verdict. What is of more consequence, he secures the
      respect of bench and bar; hereafter no one will so much as dream of
      disputing his word, should he lay claim to the years of Methuselah. That
      careful grazing shot at Colonel Waightstill, ages the horse-faced Andy
      wondrously in Cumberland estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good fortune is not yet done with Andy of the horse face. Within hours
      after the meeting in that convenient ravine, he is given new opportunity
      to fix himself in the good regard of folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is on the verge of midnight. A gentleman, unsteady with his cups, seeks
      temporary repose on the grassy litter which surrounds the tavern haystack.
      Being comfortable, and safe against a fall, he of the too many cups
      refreshes himself with his pipe. Pipe going, he falls into thought; and
      next, in the midst of his preoccupation, he sets the hay afire. It burns
      like tinder, and the flames, wind-flaunted, catch the thatched roof of the
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlement is threatened; the wild cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; is raised; from
      tavern and dwelling, men, women and children come trooping forth, clad in
      little besides looks of terror. The scene is one of confusion and
      misdirection; no one knows what to do. Meanwhile, the flames leap from the
      stable to the tavern itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is Andy the horse-faced who brings order out of chaos. Born for
      leadership, command comes easy to him. He calls for buckets, and with
      military quickness forms a double line of men between the river and the
      flames. The full buckets chase each other along one line, while the
      empties are returned by the second to be refilled. When the lines are
      working in watery concord, he organizes the balance of the community into
      a wet-blanket force. By his orders, coverlets, tablecloths, blankets,
      anything, everything that will serve, are dipped in the river and spread
      on exposed roofs. In an encouragingly short space, the fire is checked and
      the settlement saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the excitement is at its height, that pipe incendiary, who started
      the conflagration, breaks through the double line of water passers, and
      begins to give orders. He is as wild as was Nero at the burning of Rome.
      Finding this person disturbing the effective march of events, the
      horse-faced Andy&mdash;who is nothing if not executive&mdash;knocks him
      down with a bucket. The Cumberland Nero falls into the river, and the
      ducking, acting in happy conjunction with the stunning thump, brings him
      to the shore a changed and sobered man. That bucket promptitude, wherewith
      he deposed Nero, becomes one of those several immediate arguments which
      make mightily for the communal advancement of Andy the horse-faced.

      CHAPTER V&mdash;THE WINNING OF A WIFE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL these energetic
      matters happen at aforesaid, is dancing attendance upon the court. The
      fame of them travels to Nashville in advance of his return, and works a
      respectful change toward him in the attitude of the public. Hereafter he
      is to be called &ldquo;Andrew&rdquo; by ones who know him well; while others, less
      acquainted, will on military occasions hail him as &ldquo;Cap'n&rdquo; and on civil
      ones as &ldquo;Square.&rdquo; On every hand, reference to him as &ldquo;horse-faced&rdquo; is to
      be dropped; wherefore this history, the effort of which is to follow close
      in the wake of the actual, will from this point profit by that polite
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The household at the widow Donelson's learns of the Jonesboro valor and
      executive promptitude of the young State's Attorney. The blooming Rachel
      rejoices, while her Jonesboro, where the horse-faced one, in the interests
      of the creditor class drunken spouse turns sullen. His jealousy of Andrew
      is multiplied, as that young gentleman's fame increases. The fame,
      however, is of a sort that seriously mislikes the drunken Robards, who is
      at heart a hare. Wherefore, while his jealousy grows, he no longer makes
      it the tavern talk, as was his sottish wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affairs run briskly prosperous with Andrew, and he finds himself engaged
      in half the litigation of the Cumberland. There is little money, but the
      region owns a currency of its own. Some wise man has said that the
      circulating medium of Europe is gold, of Africa men, of Asia women, of
      America land. The client's of Andrew reward his labors with land, and many
      a &ldquo;six-forty,&rdquo; by which the slang of the Cumberland identifies a section
      of land, becomes his. Finally he owns such an array of wilderness square
      miles, polka-dotted about between the Cumberland and the Mississippi, that
      the aggregate acreage swells into the thousands. Those acres, however, are
      hardly more valuable than are the brown leaves wherewith each autumn
      carpets them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the ardent Andrew is pushing his way at the bar, and accumulating
      &ldquo;six-forties,&rdquo; he continues to board at the widow Donelson's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blooming Rachel delights in his society&mdash;so polished, so
      splendidly different from that of the drunkard Robards! Once or twice,
      too, when Andrew, in his saddlebag excursions from court to court, has a
      powder-burning brush with Indians and saves his sandy scalp by a narrowish
      margin, the red cheek of Rachel is seen to whiten. That is to say, the
      drunkard Robards sees it whiten; the purblind Andrew never once observes
      that mark of tender concern. The pistol repute of the decisive Andrew
      serves when he is by to stifle remark on the lip of the recreant Robards.
      But there come hours when the latter has the blooming Rachel to himself,
      at which time he raves like one demon-possessed. He avers that the
      unconscious Andrew is the lover of the blooming Rachel, and in so doing
      lies like an Ananias. However, the drunken one has the excuse of jealousy;
      which emotion is not only green-eyed but cross-eyed, and of all things&mdash;as
      history shows&mdash;most apt to mislead the accurate vision of folk.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Andrew overflows of sentiment, and often in moments of loneliness turns
      homesick. This is the more marvelous, since never from his very cradle
      days has he had a home. Being homesick&mdash;one may as well call it that,
      for want of a better word&mdash;he goes out to the orchard fence, a lonely
      spot, cut off from view by intercepting bushes, and devotes himself to
      melancholy. This melancholy, as often happens with high-strung,
      vanity-bitten young gentlemen, is for the greater part nothing more than
      the fomentations of his egotism and conceit. But Andrew does not know this
      truth, and wears a fine tragic air as one beset of what poets term &ldquo;a
      nameless grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day the blooming Rachel discovers the melancholy Andrew, dreamily
      mournful by the orchard fence. She watches him unperceived, and her gentle
      bosom yearns over him. The blooming Rachel is not wanting in that taint of
      romanticism to which all border folk are born; and now, to see this
      Hector!&mdash;this lion among men!&mdash;so bent in sadness, moves her
      tenderly. At that it is only a kind of maternal tenderness; for the
      blooming Rachel has a wealth of mother love, and no children upon whom to
      lavish it. She stands looking at the melancholy one, and would give worlds
      if she might only take his head to her sympathetic bosom and cherish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blooming Rachel approaches, and cheerily greets the gloomy one. She
      seeks to uplift his spirits. Under the sweet spell of her, he tells how
      wholly alone he is. He speaks of his mother and how her very grave is
      lost. He relates how the Revolution swallowed up the lives of his two
      brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was buried the week before I was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two stay by the orchard fence a long while, and talk on many things;
      but never once on love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drunken Robards, fiend-guided, gets a green-eyed glimpse of them. With
      that his jealousy receives added edge, and&mdash;the better to decide upon
      a course&mdash;he hurries to a grog-gery to pour down rum by the cup.
      Either he drinks beyond his wont, or that rum is of sterner impulse than
      common; for he becomes pot-valorous, and with curses vows the death of
      Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drunken Robards, filled with rum to the brim, issues forth to execute
      his threats. He finds his victim still sadly by the orchard fence; but
      alone, since the blooming Rachel has been called to aid in supper-getting.
      The pot-valorous Robards bursts into a torrent of jealous recrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy Andrew cannot believe his ears! His melancholy takes flight
      when he does understand, and in its stead comes white-hot anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you scoundrel!&rdquo; he roars. The blue eyes blaze with such ferocity
      that Robards the craven starts back. In a moment the other has control of
      himself. &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; he grits, &ldquo;you shall give me satisfaction!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robards the drunken says nothing, being frozen of fear. The enraged Andrew
      stalks away in quest of the taciturn Overton who owns those hair triggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us take a walk,&rdquo; says hair-trigger Overton, running his arm inside
      the lean elbow of Andrew. Once in the woods, he goes on: &ldquo;What do you want
      to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill him! I would put him in hell in a second!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless! Having killed him, what then will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me explain: You kill Robards. His wife is a widow. Also, because you
      have killed Robards in a quarrel over her, she is the talk of the
      settlement. Therefore, I put the question: Having made Rachel the scandal
      of the Cumberland, what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a long, embarrassed pause. Presently Andrew lifts his gaze to the
      cool eyes of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall offer her marriage. She shall, if she accept it, have the
      protection of my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; goes on the ice-and-iron Overton, &ldquo;the scandal will be
      redoubled. They will say that you and Rachel, plotting together, have
      murdered Robards to open a wider way for your guilty loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Andrew takes a deep breath. &ldquo;What would you counsel?&rdquo; he asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo;&mdash;laying his hand on Andrew's shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;under no
      circumstances, not even to save your own life, must you slay Robards. You
      might better slay Rachel; since his death by your hand spells her
      destruction. Good people would avoid her as though she were the plague.
      Never more, on the Cumberland, should she hold up her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night the fear-eaten Robards solves the situation which his crazy
      jealousy has created. He starts secretly for the North. He tells two or
      three that he will never more call the blooming Rachel wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a month there is much silence, and some restraint, at the widow
      Donelson's. This condition wears away; and, while no one says so,
      everybody feels relaxed and relieved by the absence of the drunken
      Robards. No one names him, and there is tacit agreement to forget the
      creature. The drunken Robards, however, has no notion of being forgotten.
      Word comes down from above that he will return and reclaim his wife. At
      this the black eyes of Rachel sparkle dangerously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That monster,&rdquo; she cries, &ldquo;shall never kiss my lips, nor so much as touch
      my hand again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By advice of her mother, and to avoid the drunken Robards&mdash;who
      promises his hateful appearance with each new day&mdash;the blooming
      Rachel resolves to take passage on a keel boat for Natchez. Andrew, in
      deep concern, declares that he shall accompany her. He says that he goes
      to protect her from those Indians who make a double fringe of savage peril
      along the Cumberland, the Ohio, and the Mississippi. Overton, the
      taciturn, shrugs his shoulders; the keel-boat captain is glad to have with
      him the steadiest rifle along the Cumberland, and says as much; the
      blooming Rachel is glad, but says so only with her eyes; the Nashville
      good people say nothing, winking in silence sophisticated eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robards the drunken, now when they are gone, plays the ill-used husband to
      the hilts. He seems to revel in the rôle, and, to keep it from cooling in
      interest, petitions the Virginia Legislature for a divorce. In course of
      time the news climbs the mountains, and descends into the Cumberland, that
      the divorce is granted; while similar word floats down to Natchez with the
      keel boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow story of the blooming Rachel's release reaches our two in
      Natchez. Thereupon Andrew leads Rachel the blooming before a priest; and
      the priest blesses them, and names them man and wife. That autumn they are
      again at the widow Donelson's; but the blooming Rachel, once Mrs. Robards,
      is now Mrs. Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slander is never the vice of a region that goes armed to the teeth. Thus
      it befalls that now, when the two are back on the Cumberland, those
      sophisticated ones forget to wink. There comes not so much as the arching
      of a brow; for no one is so careless of life as all that. The whole
      settlement can see that the dangerous Andrew is watching with those
      steel-blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first suggestion that his Rachel has been guilty of wrong, he will
      be at the throat of her maligner like a panther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time flows on, and a horrible thing occurs. There comes a new word that no
      divorce was granted by that Legislature; and this new word is
      indisputable. There <i>is</i> a divorce, one granted by a court; but, as
      an act of separation between Rachel the blooming and the drunken Robards,
      that decree of divorce is long months younger than the empowering act of
      the Richmond Legislature, which mistaken folk regarded as a divorce. The
      good priest's words, when he named our troubled two as man and wife, were
      ignorantly spoken. During months upon months thereafter, through all of
      which she was hailed as &ldquo;Mrs. Jackson,&rdquo; the blooming Rachel was still the
      wife of the drunken Robards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow strikes Andrew gray; but he says never a word. He blames himself
      for this shipwreck; where his Rachel was involved, he should have made all
      sure and invited no chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The injury is done, however; he must now go about its repair. There is a
      second marriage, at which the silent Overton and the widow Donelson are
      the only witnesses, and for the second time a priest congratulates our
      storm-tossed ones as man and wife. This time there is no mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young husband sends to Charleston; and presently there come to him
      over the Blue Ridge, the finest pair of dueling pistols which the
      Cumberland has ever beheld. They are Galway saw-handles, rifle-barreled; a
      breath discharges them, and they are sighted to the splitting of a hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they for?&rdquo; asks Overton the taciturn, balancing one in each
      experienced hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eyes of Andrew gathers that steel-blue look of doom. &ldquo;They are to
      kill the first villain who speaks ill of my wife,&rdquo; says he.

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;DEAD-SHOT DICKINSON
    </h2>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE sandy-haired
      Andrew now devotes himself to the practice of law and the domestic
      virtues. In exercising the latter, he has the aid of the blooming Rachel,
      toward whom he carries himself with a tender chivalry that would have
      graced a Bayard. Having little of books, he is earnest for the education
      of others, and becomes a trustee of the Nashville Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the good people of the Cumberland, and of the regions
      round about, believing they number more than seventy thousand souls, are
      seized of a hunger for statehood. They call a constitutional convention at
      Knoxville, and Andrew attends as a delegate from his county of Davidson.
      Woolsack McNairy, his fellow student in the office of Spruce Mc-Cay, is
      also a delegate. The woolsack one has-realized that dream of old
      Salisbury, and is now a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew and woolsack McNairy are members of the committee which draws a
      constitution for the would-be commonwealth. The constitution, when framed,
      is brought by its authors into open convention, and wranglingly adopted.
      Also, &ldquo;Tennessee&rdquo; is settled upon for a name, albeit the ardent Andrew,
      who is nothing if not tribal, urges that of &ldquo;Cumberland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constitution goes, with the proposition of statehood, before Congress
      in Philadelphia; and, following a sharp fight, in which such fossilized
      ones as Rufus King oppose and such quick spirits as Aaron Burr sustain,
      the admission of &ldquo;Tennessee,&rdquo; the new State is created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its hunting-shirt citizenry, well pleased with their successful step in
      nation building, elect Andrew to the House of Representatives. A little
      later, he is taken from the House and sent to the Senate. There he meets
      with Mr. Jefferson, who is the Senate's presiding officer, being
      vice-president of the nation, and that accurate parliamentarian and
      polished fine gentleman writes of him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never speaks on account of the rashness of his feelings. I have seen
      him attempt it repeatedly, but as often choke with rage.&rdquo; There also he
      encounters Aaron Burr; and is so far socially sagacious as to model his
      deportment upon that of the American Chesterfield, ironing out its
      backwoods wrinkles and savage creases, until it fits a <i>salon</i> as
      smoothly well as does the deportment of Burr himself. Our hero finds but
      one other man about Congress for whom he conceives a friendship equal to
      that which he feels for Aaron Burr, and he is Edward Livingston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew the energetic discovers the life of a senator to be one of dawdling
      uselessness, overlong drawn out; and says so. He anticipates the acrid
      Randolph of Roanoke, and declares that he never winds his watch while in
      Congress, holding all time spent there as wasted and thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idleness rusts him; and, being of a temper even with that of best Toledo
      steel, he refuses to rust patiently. Preyed upon and carked of an
      exasperating leisure, which misfits both his years and his fierce
      temperament, he seeks refuge in what amusements are rife in Philadelphia.
      He goes to Mr. McElwee's Looking-glass Store, 70 South Fourth Street, and
      pays four bits for a ticket to the readings of Mr. Fennell, who gives him
      Goldsmith, Thompson and Young. The readings pall upon him, and athirst for
      something more violent, he clinks down a Mexican dollar, witnesses the
      horsemanship at Mr. Rickett's amphitheater, and finds it more to his
      horse-loving taste. When all else fails, he buys a seat in a box at the
      Old Theater in Cedar Street, and is entertained by the sleight of hand of
      wizard Signor Falconi. On the back of it all he grows heartily sick of the
      Senate, and of civilization, as the latter finds exposition in
      Philadelphia, and resigns his place and goes home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrives in Nashville, the Legislature&mdash;which still holds that
      he should be engaged upon some public work&mdash;elects him to the supreme
      bench....

      ....objectionable Mr. Bean with those Galway saw-handles; and that violent
      person surrenders unconditionally. In elucidating his sudden tameness and
      its causes, Mr. Bean subsequently explains to a disgusted admirer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looks at the Jedge, an' I sees shoot in his eye; an' thar warn't shoot
      in nary 'nother eye in the crowd. So I says to myse'f, says I, 'Old Hoss,
      it's about time to sing small!' An' I does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding those leaden exchanges with the Governor, and the conquest
      of the discreet Mr. Bean, our jurist finds the bench inexpressibly
      tedious. At last he resigns from it, as he did from the Senate, and again
      retreats to private life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here his forethoughtful Scotch blood begins to assert itself, and he goes
      seriously to the making of money. With his one hundred and fifty slaves,
      he tills his plantation as no plantation on the Cumberland was ever tilled
      before; and the cotton crops he &ldquo;makes&rdquo; are at once the local boast and
      wonder. He starts an inland shipyard, and builds keel and flat boats for
      the river commerce with New Orleans. He opens a store, sells everything
      from gunpowder to quinine, broadcloth by the bolt to salt by the barrel,
      and takes his pay in the heterogeneous currency of the region, whereof
      'coon skins are a smallest subsidiary coin. Also, it is now that he is
      made Major General of Militia, an honor for which he has privily panted,
      even as the worn hart panteth for the water brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he is a general, the blooming Rachel cuts and bastes and stitches a
      gorgeous uniform for her Bayard, in which labor of love she exhausts the
      Nashville supply of gold braid. Once the new General dons that effulgent
      uniform, which he does upon the instant it is completed, he offers a
      spectacle of such brilliancy that the bedazzled public talks facetiously
      of smoked glass. The new General in no wise resents this jest, being
      blandly tolerant of a backwoods sense of humor which suggests it. Besides,
      while the public has its joke, he has the uniform and his commission; and
      these, he opines, give him vastly the better of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many friends, many foes, says the Arab, and now the popular young General
      finds his path grown up of enemies. There be reasons for the sprouting of
      these malevolent gentry. The General is the idol of the people. He can
      call them about him as the huntsman calls his hounds. At word or sign from
      him, they follow and pull down whatsoever man or measure he points to as
      his quarry of politics. This does not match with the ambitions of many a
      pushing gentleman, who is quite as eager for popular preference, and&mdash;he
      thinks&mdash;quite as much entitled to it, as is the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      These disgruntled ones, baffled in their political advancement by the
      General, take darkling counsel among themselves. The decision they arrive
      at is one gloomy enough. They cannot shake the General's hold upon the
      people. Nothing short of his death promises a least ray of relief. He is
      the sun; while he lives he alone will occupy the popular heavens. His
      destruction would mean the going down of that sun. In the night which
      followed, those lesser plotting luminaries might win for themselves some
      twinkling visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the springtime of the malevolent ones' conspiracy, and the plot they
      make begins to blossom for the bearing of its lethal fruit. There is in
      Nashville one Charles Dickinson. By profession he is a lawyer, albeit of
      practice intermittent and scant. In figure he is tall, handsome, graceful
      with a feline grace. If there be aught in the old Greek's theory touching
      the transmigration of souls, then this Dickinson was aforetime and in
      another life a tiger. He is sinuous, powerful, vain, narrowly cruel, with
      a sleek purring gloss of manner over all. Also, he is of &ldquo;good family&rdquo;&mdash;that
      defense and final refuge of folk who would else sink from respectable
      sight in the mire of their own well-earned disrepute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dickinson has one accomplishment, a physical one. So nicely does his
      eye match his hand, that he may boast himself the quickest, surest shot in
      all the world. Knowing his vanity, and the deadly certainty of his
      pistols, the conspirators work upon him. They point out that to kill the
      General under circumstances which men approve, will be an easy instant
      step to greatness. Urged by his vanity, permitted by his cruelty,
      dead-shot Dickinson rises to the glittering lure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give a man station and fortune, and while his courage is not sapped his
      prudence is promoted. The poor, obscure man will risk himself more readily
      than will the eminent rich one, not that he is braver, but he has less to
      lose. The General&mdash;who has been in both Houses of Congress, and was a
      judge on the bench besides&mdash;will not be hurried to the field, as
      readily as when he was merely Andrew the horse-faced. However, those
      malignant secret ones are ingenious. They know a name that cannot fail to
      set him ablaze for blood. They whisper that name to dead-shot Dickinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a banner day at the Clover Bottom track. The General's Truxton is to
      run&mdash;that meteor among race horses, the mighty Truxton! The blooming
      Rachel, seated in her carriage, is where she can view the finish. The
      General&mdash;one of the Clover Bottom stewards&mdash;is in the judge's
      stand. Dead-shot Dickinson, as the bell rings on the race, takes his stand
      at the blooming Rachel's carriage wheel. He is not there to see a race,
      but to plant an insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; cries the starter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away rushes the field, the flying Truxton in the lead! Around they whirl,
      the little jockeys plying hand and heel! They sweep by the three-quarters
      post! The great Truxton, eye afire, nostrils wide, comes down the stretch
      with the swiftness of the thrown lance! Behind, ten generous lengths,
      trail the beaten ruck! The red mounts to the cheek of the blooming Rachel;
      her black eyes shine with excitement! She applauds the invincible Truxton
      with her little hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is running away with them!&rdquo; she cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead-shot Dickinson turns to the friend who is conveniently by his side.
      The chance he waited for has come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Running away with them!&rdquo; he sneers, repeating the phrase of the blooming
      Rachel. &ldquo;To be sure! He takes after his master, who ran away with another
      man's wife.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;HOW THE GENERAL FOUGHT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE General seeks
      the taciturn Over-ton&mdash;that wordless one of the uneasy hair triggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a plot,&rdquo; says the General. &ldquo;And yet this man shall die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hair-trigger Overton bears a challenge to dead-shot Dickinson, and is
      referred to that marksman's second, Hanson Catlet. Hair-trigger Overton
      and Mr. Catlet agree on Harrison's Mills, a long Day's ride away in
      Kentucky. There are laws against dueling in Tennessee; wherefore her
      citizens, when bent on blood, repair to Kentucky. To make all equal, and
      owning similar laws, the Kentuckians, when blood hungry, take one another
      to Tennessee. The arrangement is both perfect and polite, not to say
      urbane, and does much to induce friendly relations between these sister
      commonwealths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Place selected, Mr. Catlet insists upon putting off the fight for a week.
      His principal is nothing if not artistic. He must send across the Blue
      Ridge Mountains for a famous brace of pistols. His duel with the General
      will have its page in history. He insists, therefore, upon making every
      nice arrangement to attract the admiration of posterity. He will kill the
      General, of course; and, by way of emphasizing his gallantry, offers
      wagers to that effect. He bets three thousand dollars that he will kill
      the General the first fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General makes no wagers, but holds long pow-wows with hair-trigger
      Overton over their glasses and pipes. The fight is to be at twelve paces,
      each man toeing a peg. The word agreed on is: &ldquo;Fire&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;stop!&rdquo;
       Both are free to kill after the word &ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;Stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hair-trigger Overton and the General give themselves up to a heartfelt
      study of what advantages and disadvantages are presented by the situation.
      They decide to let the gifted Dickinson shoot first. He is so quick that
      the General cannot hope to forestall his fire. Also, any undue haste on
      the General's part might spoil his aim. By the pros and cons of it, as
      weighed between them, it is plain that the General must receive the fire
      of dead-shot Dickinson. He will be hit; doubtless the wound will bring
      death. He must, however, bend every iron energy to the task of standing on
      his feet long enough to kill his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not! I'll last the time!&rdquo; says the General. &ldquo;He shall go with me;
      for I've set my heart on his blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those wonderful pistols come over the Blue Ridge, and dead-shot Dickinson
      with his friends set out for that far-away Kentucky fighting ground. They
      make gala of the business, and laugh and joke as they ride along. By way
      of keeping his hand in, and to give the confidence of his admirers a wire
      edge, dead-shot Dickinson unbends in sinister exhibitions of his pistol
      skill. At a farmer's house a gourd is hanging by a string from the bough
      of a tree. Deadrshot Dickinson, at twenty paces, cuts the string; the
      gourd falls to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some gentlemen will be along presently,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Show them that string,
      and tell them how it was cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a wayside inn he puts four bullets into a mark the size of a silver
      dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When General Jackson arrives,&rdquo; he observes, tossing a gold piece to the
      innkeeper, &ldquo;say that those shots were fired at twenty-four paces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so with song and shout and jest and pistol firing, the Dickinson party
      troop forward. They arrive in the early evening and put up at Harrison's
      tavern. The fight is for seven o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind this gay cavalcade are journeying the General and hair-trigger
      Overton. The farmer repeats the story of the gourd and its bullet-broken
      string. A bit farther, and the innkeeper calls attention to that quartette
      of shots, which took effect within the little circumference of a dollar
      piece. The stern pair behold these marvels unmoved; hair-trigger Overton
      merely shrugs his shoulders, while the General's lip curls contemptuously.
      Dead-shot Dickinson has thrown away his lead and powder if he hoped to
      shake these men of granite. Upon coming to the battle ground, the General
      and hair-trigger Overton avoid the Harrison tavern, which shelters the
      jovial Dickinson <i>coterie</i>, and put up at the inn of David Miller.
      That evening, they hold their final conference in a cloud of tobacco
      smoke, like a couple of Indians. Finally, the General goes to bed, and
      sleeps like a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first blue streaks of morning our two war parties are up and
      moving. They meet in a convenient grove of poplars. The ground is stepped
      off and pegged; after which hair-trigger Overton and Mr. Catlet pitch a
      coin. The impartial coin awards the choice of positions to Mr. Catlet, and
      gives the word to hair-trigger Overton. There is a third toss which
      settles that the weapons are to be those Galway saw-handles. At this good
      fortune a steel-blue point of fire shows in the satisfied eye of the
      General. He recalls how he procured those weapons to kill the first man
      who spoke evil of the blooming Rachel, and is pleased to think a benignant
      destiny will not permit them to be robbed of that original right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men are led to their respective pegs by Mr. Catlet and hair-trigger
      Overton. The General, through the experienced strategy of hair-trigger
      Overton, wears a black coat&mdash;high of collar, long of skirt. It
      buttons close to the chin; not a least glimpse of bullet-guiding white,
      whether of shirt collar or cravat, is allowed to show. The black coat is
      purposely voluminous; and the whereabouts of the General's lean frame,
      tucked away in its folds, is a question not readily replied to. The only
      mark on the whole sable expanse of that coat is a row of steel-bright
      buttons. These are not in the middle, but peculiarly to one side. Those
      steel-bright buttons will draw the fire of dead-shot Dickinson like a
      magnet. Which is precisely what hair-trigger Overton had in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the two stand at the pegs, dead-shot Dickinson calls loudly to a
      friend:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch that third button! It's over the heart! I shall hit him there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grim General says nothing; but the look on his gaunt face reads like a
      page torn from some book of doom. As he stands waiting the word, he is
      observed by the watchful Overton to slip something into his mouth. Then
      his jaws set themselves like flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They are ready, dead-shot Dickinson cruelly eager, the somber General
      adamant. There is a soundless moment, still as death:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, like a flash of lightning, the pistol of dead-shot Dickinson
      explodes. That objective third button disappears, driven in by the
      vengeful lead! The General rocks a little on his feet with the awful shock
      of it; then he plants himself as moveless as an oak. Through the curling
      smoke dead-shot Dickinson makes out the stark, upstanding form. For a
      moment it is as though he were planet-struck. He shrinks shudderingly from
      his peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; he whispers; &ldquo;have I missed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hair-trigger Overton cocks the pistol he holds in his hand and covers the
      horror-smitten Dickinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to your mark, sir!&rdquo; he roars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead-shot Dickinson steps up to his peg, his cheek the hue of ashes. He
      reads his sentence in those implacable steel-blue eyes, and the death
      nearness touches his heart like ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One!&rdquo; says hair-trigger Overton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word, there is a sharp &ldquo;klick!&rdquo; The General has pulled the trigger,
      but the hammer catches at half cock. The General's inveterate steel-blue
      glance never for one moment leaves his man. He recocks the weapon with a
      resounding &ldquo;kluck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two!&rdquo; says hair-trigger Overton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There comes the flash and roar, and dead-shot Dickinson is seen to
      stagger. He totters, stumbles slowly forward, and falls all along on his
      face. The bullet has bored through his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General stays by his peg&mdash;cold and hard and stern. Hair-trigger
      Overton approaches the wounded Dickinson. One glance is enough. He crosses
      to the General and takes his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There is nothing more to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hair-trigger Overton leads the General back to their inn. As the pair
      journey through the poplar wood, he asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that you put in your mouth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bullet,&rdquo; returns the General; &ldquo;I placed it between my teeth. By
      setting my jaws firmly upon it I make my hand as steady as a church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the General says this, he gives that steadying pellet of lead to
      hair-trigger Overton, who looks it over curiously. It has been crushed
      between the clenched teeth of the General until now it is as flat and thin
      as a two-bit piece. As the two approach the tavern they come upon a
      negress churning butter, and the General pauses to drink a quart of milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in his room, hair-trigger Overton pulls off the General's boot, which
      is full of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; says the General. &ldquo;His bullet found me here&rdquo;; and he throws
      open the black coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead-shot Dickinson's aim was better than his surmise. He struck that
      indicated third button; but, thanks to the strategy of hair-trigger
      Overton which prompted the voluminous coat, the button did not cover the
      General's heart. The deceived bullet has only broken two ribs and grazed
      the breastbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon is called; the wound is dressed and bandaged. He describes it
      as serious, and shakes his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;you are more fortunate than Mr. Dickinson. He
      cannot live an hour.&rdquo; As the man of probe and forceps is about to retire
      the General detains him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not to speak of my wound until we are back in Nashville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He of the probe and forceps bows assent. When he has left the room
      hair-trigger Overton asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brow of the General grows cloudy with a reminiscent war frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten those four shots inside the circle of a dollar, and
      that bullet-severed string? I want the braggart to die thinking he has
      missed a man at twelve paces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two light pipes and hair-trigger Overton sends for his whisky. Once it
      has come he gives the General a stiff four fingers, and under the fiery
      spell of the liquor the color struggles into the pale hollow of his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      He of the probe and forceps comes to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he says, palms outward with a sort of deprecatory gesture&mdash;&ldquo;gentlemen,
      Mr. Dickinson is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General knocks the ashes from his pipe. Then he crosses to the open
      window and looks out into the May sunshine. From over near the poplar wood
      drifts up the liquid whistle of a quail. Presently he returns to his seat
      and begins refilling his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It speaks worlds for your will power, that you should have kept your feet
      after being hit so hard. Not one in ten thousand could have held himself
      together while he made that shot!&rdquo; This is a marvelous burst of loquacity
      for hair-trigger Overton, who deals out words as some men deal out ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking on <i>her</i>, whom his slanderous tongue had hurt. I
      should have stood there till I killed him, though he had shot me through
      the heart!&rdquo;

      cleaned and oiled and laid away to that repose which they have won. No
      more will they be summoned to defend the blooming Rachel. No one now
      speaks evil of her; for that tragedy which reddened a May Kentucky morning
      has sealed the lips of slander. The General does not speak of that battle
      at twelve paces in the poplar wood; and yet the blooming Rachel knows.
      She, like her lover-husband, never refers to it; but her worship of him
      finds multiplication, while he, towards her, grows more and more the
      Bayard. Much are they revered and looked up to along the Cumberland, he
      for his gentle loyalty, she for her love; and the common tongue is
      tireless in reciting the story of their perfect happiness.

      The currents of time roll on and the General is busy with his planting,
      his storekeeping, and his boat building. He is fortunate; and the
      three-sided profits pile themselves into moderate riches. In the midst of
      his prosperity he is visited by Aaron Burr. The late vice-president has
      killed Alexander Hamilton&mdash;a name despised along the Cumberland. Also
      he was aforetime the champion of Tennessee, when she asked the boon of
      statehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these sundry matters, as well as for what good unconscious lessons in
      deportment were taught him by the courtly Colonel Burr, the General fails
      not to take that polished exile to his heart and to his hearth. Colonel
      Burr is in and out of Nashville many times. He comes and goes and comes
      and goes and comes again; and writes his daughter Theodosia:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am housed with General Jackson, who is one of those prompt, frank,
      loyal souls whom I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Burr has been in France, and tells the General of Napoleon. He
      draws a battle map of Quebec, shows where Montgomery fell, and relates how
      he, Colonel Burr, bore that dead chieftain from the field. In the end, he
      gives a dim outline of his dreams for the conquest of that Spanish
      America, lying on the thither side of the Mississippi; and to these latter
      tales of empire the General lends eager ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the General's suggestion a dinner is given at the Nashville Inn in
      honor of Colonel Burr. The General presides, and, with a heart full of
      anger against Barbary pirates, offers among others the toast:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Burr, being dined, confides to the General how he is not without
      an ally in the Southwest, and says that Commander Wilkinson, in control
      for the Government at New Orleans, stands ready to advance his
      anti-Spanish projects. At the name of &ldquo;Wilkinson&rdquo; the General shakes his
      prudent head. He declares that Commander Wilkinson is a faithless, caitiff
      creature, with a brandified nose, a coward heart, and a weakness for
      breaking his word. The crafty Burr, confident to vanity of his own genius
      for intrigue, insists that he can trust Commander Wilkinson. Then he
      arranges with the General for the building of a flotilla of flat-boats at
      the latter's yards, and goes his scheming way. Later, when Colonel Burr is
      on trial for treason in Richmond, the General will ride over the Blue
      Ridge to give him aid and comfort, and make street-corner speeches
      defending him, wherein he will say things more explicit than flattering
      concerning President Jefferson, who is urging the prosecution of Colonel
      Burr.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours, never resting, never sleeping, march onward with our
      planter-General, until the procession in its passing is remembered and
      spoken of as years. Then comes the war with England. That saber scar on
      the General's head begins to throb, and he sends word to Washington that
      he is ready, with twenty-five hundred of his hunting-shirt militia, to
      kill British wherever they shall be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Government thanks him, and orders him with his hunting-shirt followers
      to report to General Wilkinson at New Orleans. The General does not like
      this, the Wilkinson in question being that red-nosed renegade one, against
      whom long ago he warned the ambitious Colonel Burr. For all that, orders
      are orders; and besides a fight under any commander is not to be despised.
      The General presently hurries his hunting-shirt forces aboard flatboats,
      and floats away on the convenient bosom of the Cumberland. He will go down
      that stream to the Ohio, and so to the Mississippi and to New Orleans. As
      they float downward with the stream, the General recalls a former voyage
      when love and the blooming Rachel were his companions, and is heard to
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Natchez, word from Commander Wilkinson meets the General. He is told to
      land, and wait for further orders. The General takes his boys of the
      hunting shirts ashore, and pitches camp. Privily he unbends in oaths and
      maledictions, all addressed to the ex-grocer Wilkinson; for he thinks the
      order, preventing his entrance into New Orleans, born of the mean rivalry
      of that red-nosed ignobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General waits, and curses Commander Wilkinson, for divers weeks. Then
      occurs one of those imbecilities, of which only the witlessness of
      Government is capable, and whereof the archives at Washington carry so
      many examples. The General receives a curt dispatch from the war
      secretary, &ldquo;dismissing&rdquo; him and his hunting-shirt soldiers from the
      service of the United States. Not a word is said as to pay, or provision
      for returning to the Cumberland. Having gotten the General and his little
      army several hundred wilderness miles from home, the thick-head
      Government, with no intelligence and as little heart, coolly reduces him
      and them to the practical status of vagrants; which feat accomplished, it
      walks away, as it were, hands in pockets, whistling &ldquo;Yankee Doodle.&rdquo;
       Possibly, the Government thinks that the General and his hunting-shirt
      friends can float upstream as they floated down. The angry General,
      however, makes no such marine mistake, and the intricate oaths which he
      now evolves and fulminates, as expressive of his feelings, would have won
      the admiration of any army that ever fought in Flanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's credit is golden, since he has ever been a fanatic about
      paying debts. Invoking that credit, he cashes a handful of drafts, and
      marches home with his hunting-shirt contingent at his own expense. Also he
      indites a letter to that war secretary which reddens the latter's
      departmental ears, and causes his departmental head to buzz like a nest of
      hornets. Later, the Government pays the General the amount of those
      drafts; not because it is right&mdash;since the argument of right has
      little Washington weight&mdash;but for the far more moving reason that
      Tennessee, in a rage, is preparing to desert the boneless President
      Madison for the Federalists. It is the latter thought which brings a ray
      of common sense to the besotted Government, and his money to our General,
      now back in Tennessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bellicose General is vastly disappointed at missing a brush with
      invading British; for, aside from a saber-engrafted hatred of all English
      things and men, he is one to dote on fighting for fighting's crimson sake,
      and is almost as well pleased with mere battle as with victory. However,
      he is given scanty room for sorrowful reflections, since fate is hurrying
      to his relief with a private war of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, ever an expositor of the duello, and the peaceful hours
      resting heavy on his hands, goes out as second for a Captain Carroll
      against Mr. Jesse Benton. Captain Carroll is shot in the toe, and Mr.
      Benton in the leg; whereat the General and the Cumberland public groan
      over results so inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being thus shot in the leg, Mr. Benton displays his bad taste by falling
      into a fury with the General. He recounts what he regards as his &ldquo;wrongs&rdquo;
       to his brother Thomas, and that intemperate individual loses no time in
      taking up his brother's quarrel. The pair say things of the General which
      would arouse the wrath of an image; with that, the General calls for his
      saw-handles, and begins to plan trouble for those verbally reckless
      Bentons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General takes with him as guide, philosopher and friend, his faithful
      subaltern, Colonel Coffee. The two establish themselves, strategically, at
      the Nashville Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the corner of the public square upon which the Nashville Inn finds
      hospitable frontage, stands the City Hotel. Sunning themselves in the
      veranda of the latter caravansary, but with war written upon their angry
      visages, the General and the faithful Coffee perceive the brothers Benton.
      The enemies glare at one another, and the General says to Colonel Coffee
      that they will now go to the post office. Since a trip to the post office
      is calculated to bring them within touching distance of the brothers
      Benton, Colonel Coffee at once discerns the propriety of such a journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair go to the post office, staring haughtily at the brothers Benton
      as they pass. The brothers Benton, for their side, being apoplectic of
      habit, grow black in the face with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having visited the post office, and being now upon their return, the
      General and Colonel Coffee again draw near the apoplectic Bentons,
      glowering from their veranda. When within three feet of them, the General
      abruptly whips out one of those celebrated saw-handles, and jams its
      muzzle against the horrified stomach of brother Thomas Benton. That
      imperiled personage thereupon backs rapidly away from the saw-handle,
      which as rapidly follows; while the public, assembling on the run,
      confidently expects the General to shoot brother Thomas Benton in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General might have done so, and thus gratified the public, but the
      unexpected occurs. As brother Thomas Benton backs briskly from the muzzle
      of the saw-handle, brother Jesse, who is not wanting in a genius for
      decision, whirls, and from a huge horse pistol plants two balls in the
      General's left shoulder. As the warrior goes down, Colonel Coffee empties
      his pistol at brother Thomas, who avoids having his head blown off only by
      the fortunate fact of a cellar, into whose receptive depths he tumbles,
      just in what novelists call &ldquo;the nick of time.&rdquo; As brother Thomas lapses
      into the cellar, young Hays, a nephew of the blooming Rachel, hurls
      brother Jesse to the floor, to which he makes heartfelt attempts to pin
      him with a dirk, but is baffled by the activity of the restless brother
      Jesse, who will not lie still to be pinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole riot has not covered the space of sixty seconds, when the
      public, suddenly conceiving its duty to lie in that direction, seizes
      young Hays, releases the recumbent brother Jesse, disarms Colonel Coffee,
      fishes brother Thomas out of that receptive cellar, and carries the badly
      wounded General to a bed in the Nashville Inn. The City Hotel mentions its
      own beds, and lays claim to the injured General, on the argument that the
      battle has been fought in its bar. The claim is disallowed and the General
      conveyed to the rival hostelry aforesaid, as being peculiarly his own
      proper inn, since it is there he has ever repaired for billiards, mint
      juleps, and to hold conferences over pipe and glass with his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in bed, the local surgeons burst in and offer to cut off the
      General's arm. The offer is declined fiercely and a poultice of
      slippery-elm bark is substituted for that proposed surgery. This latter
      medicament works wonders; under its soothing influences, and the
      revivifying effects of whisky&mdash;both being remedies much in vogue
      along the Cumberland&mdash;the General begins to mend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, the patient object of a deal of slippery-elm bark and whisky&mdash;the
      one applied externally and the other internally&mdash;lies in bed a month.
      Then the awful word arrives of the massacre at Fort Mims. Five hundred and
      fifty-three souls have been slaughtered, and Chief Weathersford with all
      his Creeks, valor sharpened by English gold and English firewater, is
      reported on the warpath. The news brings the General out of bed in a
      moment. His friends remonstrate, the doctors command, the blooming Rachel
      pleads; but he puts them aside. Gaunt of cheek, face paper-white with
      weakness, left arm in a sling, he climbs painfully into the saddle and
      takes command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General sends Colonel Coffee and his mounted riflemen to the fore,
      with orders to wait for him at Fayettesville. Meanwhile, he himself
      lingers briefly to enroll and organize his little army. A few weeks later
      he follows the doughty Coffee, and the entire command&mdash;horns full of
      powder, pouches heavy with bullets, hunting knives whetted to a razor edge&mdash;moves
      southward after hostile Creeks.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE GENERAL AT THE HORSESHOE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE General goes to
      Fayettesville, and orders Colonel Coffee with his eager five hundred to
      Huntsville, as a point nearer the heart of savage war. Volunteers, each
      bringing his own rifle and riding his own horse, join Colonel Coffee, who
      sends back inspiring word that his five hundred have grown to thirteen
      hundred, all thirsting for Creek blood. Meanwhile, the General, weak and
      worn to a shadow, can hardly keep the saddle, and must be bathed hourly in
      whisky to hold soul and body together. Unable to eat, he lives by his will
      alone. The shot-shattered left arm, lest he faint with the awful agony
      which attends its least disturbance, is bound tightly to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General takes the field, and presently comes up with the Creeks. He
      smites them hip and thigh at Tallushatches, Talladega, and divers other
      places of equally complicated names, slaying hundreds while losing few
      himself. The Creeks give way before the invincible General. Wherever he
      goes they scatter like an affrighted flock of blackbirds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian is terrible only when he is winning. He is not upholstered,
      whether mentally or morally, for an uphill, losing war. The General would
      like it better if this were otherwise. Could he but coax his evanescent
      enemy into a pitched battle, he would break both his heart and his power
      with one and the same blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chief Weathersford is as well aware of this defect in the Indian make-up
      as is the General. He himself is half white, and knows what points of
      strength and weakness belong with either race. Wherefore, when now his
      Creeks have been beaten, and their hearts are low in defeat, he makes no
      effort to lead them against the General's front; but breaks them into
      squads and little bands, with directions to harass the hunting-shirt men
      and hang about their flanks in the name of flea-bite annoyance and
      isolated scalps. Thus is the General plagued and fatigued nigh unto death,
      without once being able to lay hand upon those skulking, hiding, flying
      foot-Parthians against whom he has come forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, he and his hunting-shirt men are getting farther and farther from
      anything that might be termed a base of supplies. At last, many a pathless
      mile through wood and swamp, and many an unbridged river, lie between the
      nearest barrel of flour and their stomachs clamorous for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military stomach is the first great base of every military operation.
      The war-wise Frederick had it for his aphorism, that an army is so much
      like a snake it can move forward only on its belly. The General is made
      painfully aware of this truism when he and his hunting-shirt men find
      themselves penned up with starvation at Fort Strother. In the teeth of his
      troubles, however, he makes shift to send home an orphaned papoose for the
      blooming Rachel to raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Famine takes command at Fort Strother, and the General writes: &ldquo;He is an
      enemy I dread more than hostile Creeks&mdash;I mean the meager monster,
      Famine!&rdquo; There is murmuring among the hunting-shirt men, who have, with
      the appetite common to bordermen, that contempt of discipline which
      belongs to their rude caste. They are reduced to roots and berries, with
      an occasional pigeon or squirrel, which latter diminutive deer no one
      waits to cook, but devours raw. One day a backwoods boy, whose appetite is
      even with his effrontery, waylays the General on his rounds and demands
      food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is what I was saving for supper,&rdquo; says the General; &ldquo;you may have
      that.&rdquo; And he tosses the hungry one a double handful of acorns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The starving hunting-shirt men mutiny; they draw themselves up preparatory
      to marching north, to find that home-fatness which waits for them on the
      Cumberland. At this the General changes his manner. Heretofore he has been
      the symbol of fatherly sympathy and toleration. He can make excuses for
      the grumbling of hungry men, and makes them. But this goes beyond
      grumbling, which, when all is in, comes to be no more than a healthful
      blowing off of angry steam; this is desertion by wholesale.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lean-flanked, rancorous ones line up to begin their homeward march,
      the General, haggard and emaciated by those Benton wounds and a want of
      food, rides out in front. Halting forty yards from the foremost mutineers,
      he swings from the saddle. In his right hand he carries a long
      eight-square rifle. This, since he has no left hand to support his aim, he
      runs across the empty saddle. Being ready, he calls on the hunting-shirt
      men to give the order to march, if they dare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For by the Eternal,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I'll shoot down the first of you who takes
      a forward step!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sulky, hungry hunting-shirt men scowl at the General. He scowls back
      at them, with the wicked ferocity of a tiger and an iron determination not
      to be revoked. And thus they stand glaring&mdash;one against hundreds!
      Then the courage of the hungry hundreds oozes away, and they fall back
      before that menacing apparition which glowers at them along the rifle
      barrel. They melt away by the rear, those hunting-shirt men, and lurk off
      to their quarters&mdash;ashamed of their weakness, yet afraid to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, a herd of beef, quite as gaunt as the starved hunting-shirt men
      themselves, arrives. Fires are set going and knives drawn. There is a
      measureless eating. Belts are let out to the full-fed holes of other days;
      mutiny, like an evil spirit, takes its flight. The gorged hunting-shirt
      men, as though in amends for their scowl-ings and mutinous grumblings, beg
      to be led instantly against the Creeks. This the General is very willing
      to do, since he suspects the Creeks of possessing corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's scouts tell him that the scattered Creeks are collecting in
      force at the Horseshoe. Upon this news, one bright morning the General
      rides out of Fort Strother, and his recuperated hunting-shirt men, two
      thousand strong, are at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Horseshoe is a loop-like bend in the Tallapoosa, which incloses a
      round one hundred heavily-timbered acres. Across the open end, three
      hundred and fifty yards wide, the British engineers have taught the Creeks
      to throw up a fortification of logs. Behind this bulwark is gathered the
      fighting flower of the Creeks, more than one thousand warriors in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving in front of the log bulwark, the General, with the experienced
      Coffee, pushes forward to reconnoiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can thank the British for that,&rdquo; says the General, tossing his
      indignant right hand toward the Creek defenses. &ldquo;Billy Weathers-ford, even
      with the half-white blood that's in him, would never have designed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The astute Coffee makes a suggestion and, acting on it, the General
      dispatches him by a roundabout march to take the Creeks from behind. The
      fatuous savages flatter themselves that the wide-flowing Tallapoosa will
      defend their rear. All they need do, they think, is lie behind those
      English-log breastworks and knock over whatever obnoxious paleface shows
      his head. This is an admirable programme, and comforting to the cockles of
      the aboriginal heart. There is but one trouble; it won't work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the circuitous Coffee begins to swing wide for his stealthy creep to
      the rear, the General covers the strategy with a brace of brawling
      nine-pounders. Inside the log breastworks, he hears the &ldquo;tunk! tunk!&rdquo; of
      the &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; drum, and the measured chant of the prophets promising
      victory. In the midst of the prophetic chantings and the dull thumping of
      the tomtoms, the nine-pounders roar and bury their shot in the log
      breastworks. The shot do no harm, and serve but to excite the ribald mirth
      of the Creeks. The latter can speak enough English for the purposes of
      insult, and scoff and jeer at the General, whom they describe&mdash;having
      in mind his lean form&mdash;as a lance shaft, harmless, because wanting a
      keen head. They storm at him with opprobrious epithet, and invite him,
      unless he be a coward, to come to them over their breastworks. The General
      pays no heed to the contumely of the Creeks; he is bending his ear to
      catch, above the din of his nine-pounders, the earliest signal of the
      redoubtable Coffee's attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Coffee and his riflemen, horses at a walk, pick their difficult
      way through the woods. It is a matter of no little time before they find
      themselves at the toe of the Horseshoe, and in the ignorant rear of the
      Creeks. Between them and those one hundred tree-grown acres held by the
      enemy flows the Tallapoosa&mdash;turbid, wide and deep. Across, they see
      the canoes, which the stupidity of the Creeks has left without so much as
      a squaw or a papoose to guard them. In a moment, a score have thrown off
      their hunting shirts, and are in the river. They swim like so many
      Newfoundlands, and come out dripping, but happy, on the farther side.
      Presently each of the swimming score is upon his return trip, towing a
      dozen of the largest canoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving a horse guard to look after the mounts, Colonel Coffee embarks his
      command in the canoes; ten minutes later, the last fighting man jack of
      them is on the other side. They hear the boom of the nine-pounders, and
      the yells and war shouts of the Creeks. Also they discover the wickiups of
      the Creeks, hidden away, with their squaws and papooses, in a thickety
      corner of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Coffee, who, for all he is a backwoodsman, is not without certain
      sparks and spunks of military skill, sets fire to the wickiups, as an
      excellent sure method of wringing the withers and distracting the
      attention of the fighting Creeks at the front. The flames go crackling
      skyward; the squaws and papooses rush yelling from the slight houses of
      wattled willow twigs and bark, and scuttle into the underbrush like
      rabbits. Unlike rabbits, being in the underbrush, they set up such a
      dismal tempest of howls, that those rearmost Creeks who hear it come
      running to learn what disaster has seized upon their households.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they can make extensive inquiry, Colonel Coffee and his riflemen
      open on them with a storm of bullets; and next, each man takes a tree. The
      war now proceeds Creek fashion, every man&mdash;white and red&mdash;fighting
      for himself. There is a difference, however; for while the hunting-shirt
      men are dead shots, the Creeks prove themselves such wretchedly bad
      marksmen&mdash;not understanding a rear sight, which article of gun
      furniture is a mystery to the Indian mind even unto this day&mdash;as to
      provoke a deal of hunting-shirt laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly but surely the Creeks give way before that low-flying sleet of
      lead. As they give way, running from one tree to another, their
      hunting-shirt foe presses forward&mdash;as deadly a skirmish line as ever
      commander threw out!
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick ear of the General catches the firing down at the toe of the
      Horseshoe. It tells him that Colonel Coffee is busy with the Creek rear.
      Also, he gets a far-off glimpse, through the trees, of the smoke and
      flames from those burning wickiups, and understands the message of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing off the futile nine-pounders, the General orders a charge, the
      amateur artillerists taking up their rifles with the others. At the word,
      the hunting-shirt men rush forward, and go over the log breastworks like
      cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one earliest to scale the breastworks&mdash;quick as a panther, strong
      as a bear&mdash;is Ensign Sam Houston. The Southwest will hear more of him
      before all is done. That lively youth, however, is not thinking of the
      future; for an arrow, excessively of the present, has just pierced his
      thigh, and is demanding his whole attention. Shutting his teeth like a
      trap to control the pain, he snaps the shaft and draws the arrow from the
      wound. A moment later, the surgeon bandages it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General is standing near, and waxes conservative touching Ensign Sam
      Houston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go back!&rdquo; commands the General shortly. &ldquo;That arrow through your
      leg should be enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ensign Sam Houston says nothing, but the moment his commander's back is
      turned rushes headlong over those log breastworks again. Later he is
      picked up with two bullets in him, which serve to keep him quiet for nigh
      a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the hunting-shirt men are across the log breastworks, a slow and
      painstaking killing ensues. Not a Creek asks quarter; not a Creek accepts
      it when tendered. It is to be a fight to the death&mdash;a fight
      unsparing, relentless, grim!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember Fort Mims!&rdquo; shout the hunting-shirt men, working away with,
      rifle and axe and knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Creeks, caught between the General and Colonel Coffee, hide in clumps
      of bushes or behind logs. From these slight coverts, the hunting-shirt men
      flush them, as setters flush birds, and shoot them as they fly. Once a
      Creek is down, out flashes the ready hunting knife and a Creek scalp is
      torn off; for the hunting-shirt men, on a principle that fights Satan with
      fire, have adopted the war habits of their red enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunting-shirt men range up and down, quartering those one hundred
      acres of Horseshoe wood like hounds, killing out in all directions. Now
      and then a warrior, sorely crowded, leaps into the Tallapoosa, and strikes
      forth for the opposite shore. His feather-tufted head is seen bobbing on
      the muddy surface of the river. To gentlemen who, offhand, make nothing of
      a turkey's head at one hundred yards, those brown bobbing feather-tufted
      Creek heads are child's play. A rifle cracks; the shot-pierced Creek
      springs clear of the water with a death yell, and then goes bubbling to
      the bottom. Sometimes two rifles crack; in which double event the Creek
      takes with him to the bottom two bullets instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slaughter moves forward slowly, but satisfactorily, for hours. It is
      ten o'clock in the night when the last Creek is killed, and the
      hunting-shirt men, hungry with a hard day's work, may think on supper. Of
      the red one thousand and more who manned those British-built
      fortifications in the morning, not two-score get away. It is the Creek
      Thermopylae.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's triumph at the Horseshoe puts the last paragraph to the last
      chapter of the Creek wars. Also, it disappoints certain English prospects,
      and defeats for all time those savage hopes of a general race battle
      against the paleface, the fires of which the dead Tecumseh so long
      supported by his eloquence and fed with deeds of valor. By way of a
      finishing touch, from which the hue of romance is not wanting, the
      terrible Weathersford rides in, on his famous gray war horse, and gives
      himself up to the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may kill me,&rdquo; says Weathersford. &ldquo;I am ready to die, for I have
      beheld the destruction of my people. No one will hereafter fear the
      Creeks, who are broken and gone. I come now to save the women and little
      children starving in the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      The hunting-shirt men, not at all sentimental, lift up their voices in
      favor of slaying the chief. At that the General steps in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who would kill a prisoner,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;is a dog and the son of a
      dog. To him who touches Weathersford I promise a noose and the nearest
      tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General leads his hunting-shirt men by easy marches back to that
      impatient plenty which awaits their coming on the Cumberland. The public
      welcomes him with shout and toss of hat, while the blooming Rachel gives
      her hero measureless love and tenderness. The General's one hundred and
      fifty slaves, agog with joy and fire water, make merry for two round days.
      They would have enlarged that festival to three days, but the stern
      overseer intervenes to recall them to the laborious realities of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the General begins to have the better of his fatigue and sickness&mdash;albeit
      that Benton-wounded left arm is still in a sling&mdash;a note is put in
      his hands. The note is from the War Department in Washington, and reads:
      &ldquo;Andrew Jackson of Tennessee is appointed Major General in the Army of the
      United States, vice William Henry Harrison, resigned.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X&mdash;FLORIDA DELENDA EST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE General, at the
      behest of the blooming Rachel, rests for three round weeks, which seem to
      his fight-loving soul like three round years. Then the Government sends
      him to Fort Jackson to dictate terms of peace to the broken Creeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter assemble, war paints washed off, in a deeply thoughtful, if not
      a peaceful, mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General proposes terms which well nigh amount to a wiping out of the
      Creek landed possessions. The Creeks go into secret council, as it were
      executive session, and bemoan their desperate lot. They curse the English
      who urged them to that butchery of Fort Mims and then deserted them.
      Beyond relieving their minds, however, the curses accomplish no Creek
      good. They must still face the inveterate General, whose word is, &ldquo;Your
      lives or your lands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mournful, beaten Creeks come forth from executive session, and the
      great formal conference begins. The council is called on the flat
      field-like expanse in front of the General's imposing marquee&mdash;for he
      has come to this mission with no little of pompous style, to the end that
      the Creek mind be impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Creek chiefs, blanketed to the ears, feathered to the eyes, sit about,
      crosslegged like tailors, in a half circle, their only weapon a sacred
      red-stone pipe. The General, blazing in a new uniform, comes out of his
      marquee. With him are Colonel Coffee, Colonel Hawkins, and lastly, Colonel
      Hayne, the brother of him who will one day cross blades in Senate debate
      with the lion-faced Webster, and have the worst of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the General steps forward an orderly leads up his great war horse, as
      though the conference might lapse into battle, and he must be ready to
      mount and fight. To the rear, his hunting-shirt men, one thousand strong,
      are drawn out, as following forth those precautions which produce the
      General's war horse. The Creeks, at these evidences of suspicious
      alertness, never move a bronze muscle; they pass the sacred redstone pipe
      with gravity unmoved, and puff away as though the last thing they suspect
      is suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Warrior makes a speech, and is followed by She-lok-tah, the tribal
      Demosthenes. The General shakes his grim head at their protests; there is
      no help for it, they must give him his way or fight. The Creeks bow to the
      inevitable, and give the General his way; which bowing submission is the
      less disgraceful, since both the Spanish at Pensacola and the English at
      New Orleans, in a brief handful of months, under pressures less stringent
      than are those which now and here in front of the Generali great marquee
      bear down the broken hopeless Creeks, will follow their abject example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made peace with the Creeks on the Tallapoosa, the General lets his
      angry, warseeking eye rove in the direction of Florida. Many of the
      hostile Creek Red Sticks have fled to cover there, where they are made
      welcome by the Spanish Governor Maurequez, and petted and pampered by
      Colonel Nichols and Captain Woodbine of the English. The besotted Governor
      Maurequez has permitted these latter to land an English force, and,
      inspired by his native hatred of Americans and the sight of British ships
      of war in Pensacola harbor, has surrendered to them the last stitch of
      Florida control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General guesses these things and sends out scouts to make discoveries.
      Meanwhile, he marches his hunting-shirt men to Mobile, which his instincts&mdash;never
      at fault in war&mdash;warn him will be the next English point of attack.
      Word has reached him of the downfall of Napoleon, and he foresees that
      this will release against America the utmost energies of England, who in
      thirty odd years has not forgotten Yorktown nor despaired of its repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's scouts are a sleepless, observant, close-going set of
      gentlemen, and fairly enter Pensacola. Presently, they are back with the
      news that two flags float in friendly partnership on the battlements of
      Fort St. Michael, one English and one Spanish. Also, seven English war
      ships ride in the harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They likewise say that the popinjay Colonel Nichols is issuing
      proclamations to &ldquo;The People of Louisiana,&rdquo; demanding that, as &ldquo;Frenchmen,
      Spaniards, and English,&rdquo; they arise and &ldquo;throw off the American yoke&rdquo;;
      that Captain Woodbine is assembling the fugitive Red Sticks by scores, and
      reviving their drooping spirits with English gold, English guns, English
      gin, and English red coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Woodbine, it appears, is so dull as to think he may make regular
      soldiers of the untamed Red Sticks, and drills them in the Pensacola
      plaza, where they handle their new muskets much as a cow might a cant
      hook, and look like copper-colored apes in those gorgeous red coats. The
      tactical, yet tactless, Captain Woodbine even makes his red command a
      speech, and is so unguarded as to refer to &ldquo;General Jackson.&rdquo; This is a
      blunder, since instantly half the assembled Red Sticks desert, taking with
      them the guns, gin, and jackets which have been conferred upon them. The
      oratorical Captain Woodbine is deeply impressed by the awful effect of the
      General's name upon his red recruits, and their terror communicates itself
      to him. He has difficulty in restraining himself from deserting with them,
      but takes final courage and remains. Only he is at pains to delete
      &ldquo;General Jackson&rdquo; from subsequent eloquence, and never again mentions that
      paladin of the Cumberland in the quaking presence of a Red Stick Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of adding to these hardy doings, the wordy popinjay, Colonel
      Nichols, fulminates new proclamations, comic in their ignorance and
      bombast. He believes that the formidable General can be whipped by
      manifestoes. As against this belief, however, most careful preparations
      move forward aboard the English ships, looking to the destruction of Fort
      Bowyer and the capture of Mobile; for Captain Percy of the <i>Hermes</i>,
      who has command of the fleet, is altogether a practical person, and pins
      no faith to proclamations and Indians in red coats when it comes to
      bringing a foe to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these interesting items are laid before the General by his painstaking
      scouts, and he is peculiarly struck with the word about Captain Percy and
      Mobile. He sends back his scouts for another bagful of news, and begins to
      strengthen and stiffen Fort Bowyer, thirty miles below the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having patched up this redoubt to his taste, the General puts Major
      Lawrence in command, and tells him to fight his batteries while a man
      remains alive. Major Lawrence says he will; and, not having a ship, but a
      fort, to defend, he follows as nearly as he may the motto of his heroic
      relative, and issues the watchword, &ldquo;Don't give up the Fort!&rdquo; Leaving
      Major Lawrence in this high vein, the General goes back to Mobile to
      concert plans for its protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Percy of the <i>Hermes</i> is a gallant man, but a bad judge of
      Americans. He tells the proclaiming Colonel Nichols that he will take four
      ships and capture Fort Bowyer in twenty minutes. Colonel Nichols has so
      little trouble in believing this that he conceives the deed of conquest
      already done. Full of hope and strong waters&mdash;for the English have
      not given the thirsty Red Sticks all their gin&mdash;he is so far worked
      upon by Captain Percy's turgid prophecies as to issue a new proclamation,
      declaring Fort Bowyer taken, and showing how, presently, the English
      intend doing likewise at New Orleans. Having taken time so conspicuously
      by the forelock, the anticipatory Colonel Nichols&mdash;who has never been
      in the chicken trade, and therefore knows nothing of what perils attend a
      count of poultry noses before the poultry are hatched&mdash;goes aboard
      the <i>Hermes</i>, with Captain Woodbine and others of his staff; for he
      would be on the ground, when Fort Bowyer and Mobile succumb, ready to
      assume control of those strongholds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no mighty voyage from Pensacola to Mobile, and a half day's sail
      will bring Colonel Nichols and Captain Percy within point-blank range of
      Fort Bowyer. Taking a bright, cool morning for it, Captain Percy lets fall
      his topsails, and forges seaward, followed by the cordial wishes of
      Governor Maurequez who, glass in hand, drinks &ldquo;Good voyage!&rdquo; from the
      ramparts of St. Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I regret is,&rdquo; cries the valorous Governor Maurequez, in the politest
      phrases of Castile, &ldquo;that you brave English will destroy these vagabonds,
      and thus deprive me and my heroic soldiery of the pleasure of their
      obliteration, when they shall have invaded our beloved Florida.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away go the English war ships in line, like a quartette of geese crossing
      a mill pond, the <i>Hermes</i>, Captain Percy, in the van. The fleet
      rounds the lower extremity of Mobile Point, out of range from Fort Bowyer,
      and lands Colonel Nichols with a force of foot soldiers and a howitzer.
      This military feat accomplished, the fleet, still like geese in line, bear
      up until abreast of the Fort, which is a musket shot away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no time wasted. The <i>Hermes</i> lets go her anchors and swings
      broadside-on to the Fort. The others follow suit. Then, with a crashing
      discharge of big guns by way of overture, the fight is on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes, ten minutes, twenty minutes go by; shots fly and shells
      burst, and Major Lawrence still holds the fort. Evidently Captain Percy
      cut his time too fine! Then, one hour, two hours follow, and Major
      Lawrence's twenty-four pounders are making matches of the <i>Hermes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the merry war progresses, Colonel Nichols, with much ardor and no
      discernment, drags his howitzer to a strategic sand hill, and fires one
      shot at Fort Bowyer. It is a badly considered movement, the instant effect
      being to draw the Fort's horns his way. The southern battery of the Fort
      opens upon him like a tornado, and he and his fellow artillerists retire&mdash;without
      their howitzer. The most discouraging feature is that a stone, sent flying
      from the strategic sand hill by a cannon ball, knocks out one of Colonel
      Nichols's eyes. After this exploit, the one-eyed proclamationist, much
      saddened, but with wisdom increased, is content to stand afar off, and
      leave the down-battering of Fort Bowyer to the fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This down-battering Captain Percy and his sailormen do their tarry best to
      bring about. But, as hour after hour drifts to leeward in the smoke of
      their broadsides, and the stubborn Lawrence continues to send his hail of
      twenty-four-pound shot aboard, it begins to creep upon Captain Percy, like
      mosses upon stone, that Fort Bowyer is a nut beyond the power of even his
      iron teeth to crack. As a red-hot shot sets fire to the <i>Hermes</i> and
      explodes her magazine, the impression deepens to apprehension, which, when
      the <i>Sophia</i> is reported sinking, ripens rapidly into conviction.
      Major Lawrence, with his &ldquo;Don't give up the Fort!&rdquo; all but blots Captain
      Percy&mdash;who has tenfold his force&mdash;off the face of the Gulf, and
      he does it with a loss of eight men killed and wounded to an English loss
      of over three hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Percy, whipped and broken-hearted, shifts his flag and what is
      left of his <i>Hermes''</i> crew to the <i>Sophia</i>, and, pumps clanking
      hysterically to keep-himself afloat, goes limping back to Pensacola,
      lighted on his defeated way by the flare and glare from the blazing <i>Hermes</i>.
      As the English pass the extreme southern tip of Mobile Point, as far from
      the unmannerly batteries of Fort Bowyer as the lay of the land permits,
      they pick up the one-eyed proclamationist, Colonel Nichols, and his
      howitzerless men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fleet, battered, torn, sails adroop, with the <i>Sophia</i> three feet
      below her trim from shot-admitted water in her hold, reaches Pensacola.
      Governor Maurequez looks scornfully dark, but, Spaniard-like, shrugs his
      vainglorious shoulders and says to an aide:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing! They are but English pigs! When this General Jackson
      reaches Pensacola&mdash;if he should be so great a fool as to come&mdash;we
      cavaliers of old Spain will tear him to pieces, as tigers rend their prey.
      Yes, <i>amigo</i>, we will show these beaten pigs of English how the proud
      blood of the Cid can fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Red Stick Creeks, furnished of a better intelligence, in no wise adopt
      the high-flying sentiments of Governor Maurequez. The moment the English
      come halting into the harbor, the awful name of &ldquo;General Jackson!&rdquo; leaps
      from aboriginal lip to lip. Hastily tearing off Captain Woodbine's red
      coats as garments full of probable trouble, but taking with them his new
      guns, the frightened Red Sticks head south for the Everglades, first
      drinking up what remains of their gin. Not a hostile Creek will thereafter
      be found within a day's ride of the General; all of those English plans,
      which seek the aid of savage axe and knife and torch, are to fall to
      pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Percy, made ten years older by that fight and failure at Fort
      Bowyer, goes about the repair of his ships; Colonel Nichols, omitting for
      the nonce all further proclamations, nurses his wounds; Captain Woodbine,
      having now no Indians, abandons his daily drills on the plaza; Governor
      Maurequez, whispering with his aide, brags in chosen Spanish of what he
      will do to thick-skull vagabond Americans should they put themselves in
      his devouring path; while over at Mobile the General hugs Major Lawrence
      to his bosom in a storm of approval, and gives that sterling soldier a
      sword of honor.

      CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE TWO FLAGS AT PENSACOLA
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HOSE two flags,
      one the red flag of England, flying at Pensacola, haunt the General night
      and day. His hunting-shirt men, twenty-eight hundred from his beloved
      Tennessee and twelve hundred from the territories of Mississippi and
      Alabama, are lusting for battle. He resolves to lead them into Florida,
      across the Spanish line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must rout the English out of Pensacola!&rdquo; he explains to Colonel
      Coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pensacola!&rdquo; repeats Colonel Coffee, looking thoughtful. &ldquo;It is Spanish
      territory, General! There is the boundary; and diplomacy, I believe,
      although it is an art whereof I know little, lays stress on the word
      boundary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boundary!&rdquo; snorts the General in dudgeon. &ldquo;The English are there! Where
      my foe goes, I go; my diplomacy is of the sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General elaborates; for he is not without liking the sound of his own
      voice. Governor Maurequez, he says, has welcomed the English; he must
      enlarge that welcome to include Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For I tell you,&rdquo; goes on the General, &ldquo;that I shall expect from him the
      same courtesy he extends to Colonel Nichols. Nor do I despair of receiving
      it, since I shall take my artillery. With both Americans and English among
      his guests, if trouble fall out it will be his own fault, and should teach
      him to practice hereafter a less complicated hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General prepares for the journey to Pensacola. The treasure chest
      shows the usual emptiness, and he exerts his own credit, as he did on a
      Natchez occasion, to provide for his hunting-shirt men. This time the
      Government will honor his drafts promptly, for election day is drawing
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      One sun-filled autumn morning, the General and his hunting-shirt men march
      away for Pensacola, their hearts full of cheering anticipations of a
      fight, and eight days provant in the commissariat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be there in eight days,&rdquo; says the General hopefully, &ldquo;and
      Governor Maurequez and the English must provide for us after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General does not overstate the powers of his hunting-shirt men, and
      the eighth morning finds them and him within striking distance of Fort St.
      Michael. The General shades his blue eyes with his hand and scans the
      walls with vicious lynxlike intentness in search of that hated red flag.
      His heart chills when he does not find it. There is the flag of Arragon
      and Castile; but the staff which only yesterday supported the flag of
      England stands an unfurnished, naked spar of pine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General heaves a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; he says, pathos in his tones, &ldquo;they have run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; returns the excellent Coffee, who sees that the General's
      regrets are leveled at an absence of English, and is anxious to console
      him, &ldquo;possibly they've only retired to Fort Barrancas, six miles below,
      and are waiting for us there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The disappointed General shakes his head; he does not share the confidence
      of the optimistic Coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Major Piere,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with a flag of truce to announce to the
      Spaniard our purpose of lunching with him. We will ask him, now we're
      here, by what license he gives shelter to our enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Major Piere goes forward, white flag fluttering, and is promptly fired
      upon by Governor Maurequez at the distance of six hundred yards. The balls
      fly wide and high, for the Spaniard shoots like a Creek. Finding himself a
      target, the disgusted Major Piere returns and reports his uncivil
      reception. The General's eyes blaze with a kind of blue fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out the troops!&rdquo; he roars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drums sound the long roll. The hunting-shirt men are about the cookery&mdash;being
      always hungry&mdash;of the last of those eight days' rations. When they
      fall into line, the General makes them a speech. It is brief, but
      registers the point of better provender in Pensacola than that which now
      bubbles in their coffee pots and burns on their spits. Whereat the
      hunting-shirt men cheer joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English, too, are there,&rdquo; concludes the General. Then, in a burst of
      flattering eloquence: &ldquo;And I know that you would sooner fight Englishmen
      than eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Englishmen, the hunting-shirt men give such a cheer that it
      quite throws that former cheer into the vocal shade. Everyone is in
      immediate favor of rushing on Pensacola.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General becomes cunning, and sends Colonel Coffee with a detachment of
      cavalry to threaten Fort St. Michael from the east. The Spaniards are
      singularly guileless in matters military. That feigned attack succeeds
      beyond expression, and the befogged Governor Maurequez hurries his entire
      garrison to those menaced eastern walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the excited Spaniards are making a chattering, magpie fringe along
      the eastern ramparts, the General moves the bulk of his hunting-shirt
      forces, under cover of the woods, to the fort's western face. Once they
      are placed, he gives the order:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word sends the hunting-shirt men at that mud-built citadel with a
      whoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spaniards are unstrung by surprise, and fall to pattering prayers and
      telling beads. In the very midst of their orisons, the hunting-shirt men,
      as in the fight at the Horseshoe, pour like a cataract over the parapet
      and sweep the praying, helpless Spaniards into a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work, however, is not altogether done. When Governor Maurequez gives
      the order to man the eastern walls against the deploying Coffee, he does
      not remain to see it executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having sublime faith in the heroism of his followers, for him to
      personally remain, he argues, would be superfluous. Nay, it might even be
      construed into a criticism of his devoted soldiery, as implying a fear
      that they will not fight if relieved of his fiery presence, not to say the
      fiery pressure of his commanding eye. Having thus defined his position,
      the valorous Governor Maurequez, acting in that spirit of compliment
      toward his people which has ever characterized his speech, gathers up his
      gubernatorial skirts and scuttles for his palace like a scared hen
      pheasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having swept the walls of St. Michael clean of magpie Spaniards, and run
      up the stars and stripes on the vacant English staff, the General and his
      hunting-shirt men make ready to follow Governor Maurequez to the palace.
      He is to be their host; it is their polite duty to find him with all
      dispatch and offer their compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of this urbane purpose, they wheel their bristling ranks on the town.
      Approaching double-quick, they casually lick up, as with a tongue of
      flame, a brace of abortive blockhouses which obstruct their path. At this,
      an interior fort opens fire with grapeshot and shrapnel, and the
      hunting-shirt men spring upon it with the ruthless ferocity of panthers.
      To quench it is no more than the fighting work of a moment. The General,
      with his flag already on the ramparts of Fort St. Michael, now feels his
      clutch at the very throat of Pensacola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governor Maurequez, equipped in his turn of a milk-white flag, bursts from
      the palace portals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Senores Americanos,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;spare, for the love of the Virgin, my
      beautiful Pensacola! As you hope for heaven's mercy, spare my beautiful
      city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wild hunting-shirt men are in a jocular mood. The terrified rushing
      about of Governor Maurequez excites their laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your humane General Jackson?&rdquo; wails Governor Maurequez, in
      appeal to the hunting-shirt men. &ldquo;Where is he&mdash;I beseech you? I hear
      he is the soul of merciful forbearance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the hunting-shirt laughter breaks out with double volume, as
      though Governor Maurequez has evolved a jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alarmed Governor, catching sight of a couple of dead Spaniards, fresh
      killed in the struggle with the foolish interior fort, expresses his grief
      in staccato shrieks, which serve as weird marks of punctuation to the
      laughter of the rude hunting-shirt men. The laughter ceases when the
      General himself rides up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar's the Gin'ral,&rdquo; says a hunting-shirt man, biting his merriment short
      off. &ldquo;Thar's the man of mercy you're asking for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Governor Maurequez starts back at sight of the gaunt face, emaciated by
      sickness born of those Benton bullets, and yellowed to primrose hue with
      the malaria of the Alabama swamps. The lean figure on the big war stallion
      might remind him of Don Quixote&mdash;for he has read and remembers his
      Cervantes&mdash;save for the frown like the look of a fighting falcon, and
      the fire-sparkle in the dangerous blue eyes. As it is, he feels that his
      visitor is a perilous man, and begins to bow and cringe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg the victorious Senor General,&rdquo; says he, pressing meanwhile a right
      hand to his heart, and presenting the white square of truce with the other&mdash;&ldquo;I
      beg the victorious Senor General to spare my beautiful Pensacola!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Governor Maurequez!&rdquo; returns the General, hard as flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Senor General; I am Governor Maurequez, as you say. Also&rdquo;&mdash;here
      his voice begins to shake&mdash;&ldquo;I must remind your excellency that this
      is a province of Spain, and ask by what right you invade it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; returns the General, anger rising. &ldquo;Did you not fire on my
      messenger? Sir, if you were Satan and this your kingdom, it would be the
      same! I would storm the walls of hell itself to get at an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There comes the whiplike crack of a rifle almost at the General's elbow.
      Far up the narrow street, full four hundred yards and more, a flying
      Spanish soldier throws up his hands with a death yell, and pitches forward
      on his face. At this, the hunting-shirt man who fired tosses his coonskin
      cap in the air and shouts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar, Bill Potter, the jug of whisky's mine! Thar's your Spaniard too
      dead to skin! If the distance ain't four hundred yard, you kin have the
      gun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; cries the General fiercely. &ldquo;Nothin', Gin'ral!&rdquo; replies the
      hunting-shirt man, abashed at the forbidding manner of the General,
      &ldquo;nothin', only Bill Potter, from the 'Possum Trot, bets me a jug of whisky
      that old Soapstick here&rdquo;&mdash;holding up his rifle as identifying &ldquo;old
      Soapstick&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;won't kill at four hundred yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betting, eh!&rdquo; retorts the General, assuming the coldly implacable. &ldquo;Now
      it's in my mind, Mr. Soapstick, that unless you mend your morals, some one
      about your size will pass an hour strung up by the thumbs so high his
      moccasins won't touch the grass! How often must I tell you that I'm bound
      to break up gambling among my troops?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rebuked soapstick one slinks away, and the General turns to Colonel
      Coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the word, Coffee, to cease firing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General's glance comes around to Governor Maurequez, still bowing and
      presenting his white flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are those English?&rdquo; he demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frightened Governor Maurequez makes the sign of the cross. He is
      sorry, but the pig English withdrew to Fort Barrancas at the first signs
      of the coming of the victorious Senor General, taking with them their
      hateful red flag. Also, it was they who fired on the messenger. If the
      victorious Senor General will but move quickly, he may catch the pig
      English before they escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, half his hunting-shirt men at his back, starts for Fort
      Barrancas. They are two miles on their way when the earth is shaken by a
      thunderous explosion. Over the tops of the forest pines a gush of black
      smoke shoots upward toward the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have blown up the fort!&rdquo; says the explanatory Coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General says nothing, but urges speed. At last they come in sight of
      what has been Fort Barrancas. It is as the astute Coffee surmised. The
      one-eyed Colonel Nichols and his English have fled, leaving a slow-match
      and the magazine to destroy what they dared not defend. Far away in the
      offing Captain Percy's English fleet&mdash;upon which the one-eyed Colonel
      Nichols and his fugitive followers have taken refuge&mdash;wind aft and an
      ebb tide to help, is speeding seaward like gulls.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE GENERAL GOES TO NEW ORLEANS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>overnor maurequez
      evolves into the very climax of the affable, not to say obsequious. He
      assures the General that he is relieved by the flight of the pig English,
      whom he despises as hare-hearts. Also, he is breathless to do anything
      that shall prove his affectionate admiration for his friend, the valorous
      Senor General.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General accepts the affectionate admiration of Governor Maurequez, and
      leaves in his care Major Laval, who has been too severely wounded to move;
      and Governor Maurequez subsequently smothers that convalescent with
      nursing solicitude and kindness. Those other twenty wounded hunting-shirt
      men the General takes back with him to Mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General now gives himself up to a profound study of maps. His invasion
      of Florida has paled the cheek of the Spanish Minister at Washington and
      given European diplomacy a chill; he knows nothing of that, however, and
      would care even less if he did. After poring over his maps for divers
      days, he comes to sundry sagacious conclusions, and sends for the
      indispensable Coffee to confer. That commander makes an admirable
      counselor for the General, since he seldom speaks, and then only to
      indorse emphatically the General's views. For these splendid qualities,
      and because he is as brave as Richard the Lion Heart, the General makes a
      point of consulting the excellent Coffee concerning every move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; says the General, as that warrior casts himself upon a bench,
      which creaks dolorously beneath his giant weight, &ldquo;Coffee, they'll attack
      New Orleans next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The listening Coffee grunts, and the General, correctly construing the
      Coffee grunt to mean agreement, proceeds:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England has now no foe in Europe. That allows her to turn upon us with
      her whole power. Even as we talk, I've no doubt but an immense fleet is
      making ready to pounce upon our coasts. Now, Coffee, the question is,
      Where will it pounce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General pauses as though for answer. The admirable Coffee emits
      another grunt, and the General understands this second grunt to be a grunt
      of inquiry. Stabbing the map before him, therefore, with his long, slim
      finger, he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Coffee, here at New Orleans. It's the least defended, and, fairly
      speaking, the most important port we have, for it locks or unlocks the
      Mississippi. Besides, it's midwinter, and such points as New York and
      Philadelphia are seeing rough, cold weather. Yes, I'm right; you may take
      it from me, Coffee, the English are aiming a blow at New Orleans.&rdquo; The
      convinced Coffee testifies by a third grunt that his own belief is one and
      the same with the General's, and the council of war breaks up. As the big
      rifleman swings away for his quarters the General observes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee, you will never realize how much I am aided by your opinions. Two
      heads are better than one, particularly when one of them is capable of
      such a clean, unfaltering grasp of a situation as is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General burns to be at New Orleans, and leaving Colonel Coffee to
      bring on his three thousand hunting-shirt men as fast as he may, gallops
      forward with four of his staff. It is a rough, evil road that threads
      those one hundred and seventy-five miles which lie between the General and
      the Mississippi, but he puts it behind him with amazing rapidity. At last
      the wide, sullen river rolls at his horse's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the General traverses the rude forest roads, difficult with November's
      mud and slush, a few days' sail away on the Jamaica coast may be seen
      proof of the pure truth of his deductions. The English admiral is
      reviewing his fleet of fifty ships, preparatory to a descent upon New
      Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a formidable flotilla, with ten thousand sailors and nine thousand
      five hundred soldiers and marines, and mounts one thousand cannon. The
      flagship is the <i>Tonnant</i>, eighty guns, and there sail in her company
      such invincibles as the <i>Royal Oak</i>, the <i>Norge</i>, the <i>Asia</i>,
      the <i>Bedford</i>, and the <i>Ramillies</i>, each carrying seventy-four
      guns. With these are the <i>Dictator</i>, the <i>Gorgon</i>, the <i>Annide</i>,
      the <i>Sea Horse</i>, and the <i>Belle Poule</i>, and the weakest among
      them better than a two-decked forty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      In command of this armada are such doughty spirits as Sir Alexander
      Cockrane, admiral of the red, Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, Rear Admiral
      Malcolm, and Captain Sir Thomas Hardy&mdash;&ldquo;Nelson's Hardy,&rdquo; who
      commanded the one-armed fighter's flagship <i>Victory</i> at Trafalgar.
      These, with their followers, have grown gray and tired in unbroken
      triumph. Now, when they are making ready to spring on New Orleans, their
      war word is &ldquo;Beauty and Booty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Review over, Admiral Cockrane in the van with the <i>Tonnant</i>, the
      fleet sails out of Negril Bay for Louisiana. As the General's horse cools
      his weary muzzle in the Mississippi, the English fleet has been two days
      on its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a dull, lowering December morning when the General, on his great war
      stallion, following the Bayou road, rides into New Orleans. He finds the
      city in a tumult, and nothing afoot for its defense. He is received by
      Governor Claiborne, a stately Virginian, and Mayor Girod, plump and little
      and gray and French, with a delegation of citizens. Among the latter is
      one whom the General recognizes. He is Edward Livingston, aforetime of New
      York, and the General's dearest friend in those old Philadelphia
      Congressional days. The General gives the Livingston hand a squeeze and
      says: &ldquo;It's like medicine in wine, Ned, to see you at such a time as
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Governor Claiborne makes a speech in English, Mayor Girod makes a speech
      in French-leading citizens make speeches in English, Spanish, and French.
      The speeches are fiery, but inconclusive. All are excited, confused, ani
      without a plan. The General replies in little more than a word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to defend your city,&rdquo; says he: &ldquo;and I shall defend it or find
      a grave among you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following this ultimatum, the General goes to dinner with Mr. Livingston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governor Claiborne, Mayor Girod, and the leading citizens remain behind to
      talk the General over in their several tongues. They are disappointed, it
      seems.
    </p>
    <p>
      There be those who wish he hadn't come. Among them is the Speaker of the
      Territorial House of Representatives&mdash;A French creole of
      anti-American sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His presence will prove a calamity!&rdquo; cries this legislative person. &ldquo;He
      seems to me to be a desperado, who will make war like a savage and bring
      destruction and fire on our city and the neighboring plantations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is no retort to this, for the local spirit of treason is widespread.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the citizens of New Orleans are discussing the General, he with his
      friend Livingston is discussing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the state of affairs here, Ned?&rdquo; asks the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could not be worse,&rdquo; is the reply. &ldquo;All is confusion, contradiction,
      and cross-purposes. The whole city seems to be walking in a circle.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;We'll see, Ned,&rdquo; returns the General grimly, &ldquo;if we can't make it walk in
      a straight line.&rdquo; Commodore Patterson comes to call on the General. He is
      one who says little and looks a deal&mdash;precisely a gentleman after the
      General's own heart, for while he himself likes to talk, he prefers
      silence in others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Patterson sets forth the naval defenses of the town. An enemy
      entering from the sea must come by way of Lake Borgne, and there are six
      baby gunboats on Lake Borgne. The flotilla is commanded by Lieutenant
      Jones, who is Welsh and therefore obstinate; he will fight to the final
      gasp. The General beams approval of Lieutenant Jones, who he thinks has a
      right notion of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; says Commander Patterson, &ldquo;he will be overcome in the
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General nods to this. He does not expect Lieutenant Jones to defend
      the city alone. Commodore Patterson continues: &ldquo;There are the schooner <i>Carolina</i>
      and the ship <i>Louisiana</i> in the river, but they are out of commission
      and have no crews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enlist crews at once!&rdquo; urges the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General appoints Mr. Livingston to his staff, and the pair make a tour
      of the suburbs and the flat, marshy regions round about. The General is
      alert, inquisitive; he is studying the strategic advantages and
      disadvantages of the place. When he returns he orders a muster of the
      city's military strength for the next day. The review occurs, and the
      General declares himself pleased with the display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commodore Patterson comes to say that, while the streets are full of
      sailors, not one will enlist. The General asks the Legislature to suspend
      the habeas corpus. That done, he will organize press gangs and enlist
      those reluctant &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; by force. The Legislature refuses, and the
      General's eyes begin to sparkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Ned,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I shall clap your city under martial law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear General,&rdquo; urges Mr. Livingston, who, being a lawyer, reveres
      the law, &ldquo;you haven't the authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Ned,&rdquo; replies the determined General, &ldquo;I have the power.
      Which is more to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General declares civil rule suspended, and puts the city under martial
      law. It is as though he lays his strong, bony hand on the shoulder of
      every man, and, the first shock over, every man feels safer for it. The
      press gangs are formed, and scores of seafaring &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; are carried
      aboard the <i>Carolina</i> and <i>Louisiana</i> in irons. Once aboard and
      irons off, the &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; become miracles of zeal and patriotic fire,
      furbishing up the dormant broadside guns, filling the shot racks, and
      making ready the magazines, hearts light as larks, as though to fight
      invading English is the one pleasant purpose of their lives; for such is
      the seafaring nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's &ldquo;press&rdquo; does not confine itself to sailors. Negroes, mules,
      carts, shovels, and picks are brought under his rigid thumb. Every gun,
      every sword, every pistol is collected and stored for use when needed.
      Meanwhile, the indefatigable Coffee arrives, marching seventy miles the
      last day and fifty the day before to join his beloved chief. Also Captain
      Hinds of the dragoons is no less headlong, and brings his command two
      hundred and thirty miles in four days, such is his heat to fight beneath
      the blue, commanding eye of the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is this all. A day goes by, and Colonel Carroll steps ashore from a
      fleet of flatboats, at the head of a hunting-shirt force from the
      Cumberland country. The backwoods cheer which goes up when the new
      hunting-shirt men see the General, brings the water to his eyes with
      thoughts of home. Lastly, Colonel Adair appears with his force of
      Kentuckians. These latter are a disappointment, being practically unarmed,
      owning but one gun among ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you got no guns for us, Gin'ral?&rdquo; asks one of the Kentucky captains
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to say I have not,&rdquo; returns the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; responds the Kentuckian, while a look of satisfaction begins to
      struggle into his face, as though he has hit upon a solution of the
      tangle, &ldquo;well, I'll tell you what we'll do, then. Which the boys'll just
      nacherally go out on the firin' line with the rest, an' then as fast as
      one of them Tennesseans gets knocked over, we'll up an' inherit his gun.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE WATCH FIRES OF THE ENGLISH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HESE are busy
      times for the General. He lives on rice and coffee, and goes days and
      nights without sleep. He sends the tireless Coffee, with his hunting-shirt
      men, to take position below the city, between the morass and the river.
      Finally he orders all his forces below&mdash;Colonel Carroll with his new
      hunting-shirt men, Colonel Adair with his unarmed Kentuckians, the
      hard-riding Captain Hinds with his dragoons, as well as the muster of
      local military companies, among the rest Major Plauche's battalion of
      &ldquo;Fathers of Families.&rdquo; There are a great many filial as well as paternal
      tears shed when the &ldquo;Fathers of Families&rdquo; march away to the field of
      certain honor and possible death; even Papa Plauche himself does not
      refrain from a sob or two. The &ldquo;Fathers of Families&rdquo; take with them their
      band, which musical organization plays the <i>Chant du Depart</i>,
      whereat, catching the <i>tempo</i>, they strut heroically. The rough
      hunting-shirt men are much interested in the &ldquo;Fathers of Families,&rdquo; and
      think them as good as a play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General busies himself about his headquarters, and waits for news of
      the English, of whose coming he has word. One afternoon appears a lean
      little dark man, with black, beady eyes, like a rat. He introduces
      himself; he is Jean Lafitte, the &ldquo;Pirate of Barrataria.&rdquo; Only he explains
      that he is really no pirate at all, not even a sailor; at the worst he is
      simply the innocent shore agent or business manager of pirates. Also, he
      declares that he is very patriotic and very rich, and might add &ldquo;very
      criminal&rdquo; without startling the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why has he come to see Monsieur General? Only to show him a letter from
      the English Admiralty, brought by the General's old friend, Captain Percy,
      late of H. R. H. Ship <i>Hermes</i>, offering him, Jean Lafitte, a
      captain's commission in the royal navy, thirty thousand dollars in English
      gold, and the privilege of looting. New Orleans, if he will but aid in the
      city's capture. Now he, Jean Lafitte, scorning these base attempts upon
      his honor, desires to offer his own and the services of his buccaneers to
      the General in repulsing those villain English, whom he looks upon with
      loathing as Greeks bearing gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; concludes Jean Lafitte, his black rat eyes taking on a sly
      expression, &ldquo;my two best captains, Dominique and Bluche, together with
      most of their crews, are locked up in the New Orleans calaboose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General considers a moment, looking the while deep into the rat eyes
      of Jean Lafitte. The scrutiny is satisfactory; there is nothing there save
      an anxiety to get his men out of jail. This the General is pleased to
      regard as creditable to Jean Lafitte. He comes back to the question in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dominique and Bluche,&rdquo; he repeats. &ldquo;Can they fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can do anything with a cannon, Monsieur General, which your
      sharpshooters do with their squirrel rifles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General has the caged Dominique and Bluche brought before him. They
      are hardy, daring, brown men of the sea, with bushy hair, curling beards,
      gold rings in their ears, crimson handkerchiefs about their heads, gay
      shirts, sashes of silk, short voluminous trousers, like Breton fisherman,
      and loose sea boots&mdash;altogether of the brine briny are Dominique and
      Bluche. One glance convinces the General. The order is issued, and the two
      pirates with their followers take their places as artillerists where the
      wary Coffee may keep an eye on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English fleet arrives and anchors off the Louisiana coast. Loaded
      scuppers-deep with soldiers and sailors and marines, the lighter craft
      enter Lake Borgne. They sight the six cockleshells of Lieutenant Jones,
      and make for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Jones, with his cockleshells, slowly and carefully retreats. He
      retreats so carefully that one after another the English boats, to the
      round number of a score, run aground on divers mud banks, where they
      stick, looking exceeding foolish. When the last pursuing boat is fast on
      the mud banks, Lieutenant Jones anchors his six cockleshells where the
      English may only get at him in small boats, and awaits results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English are in no wise backward. Down splash the small boats, in
      tumble the men, and presently they are pulling down upon the waiting
      Lieutenant Jones&mdash;twelve men for every one of his. The small boats
      have swivels mounted in their bows, and by way of preliminary, stand off
      from the six cockleshells, waging battle with their little bow guns. This
      is a mistake. Lieutenant Jones returns the fire from his cockleshells,
      sinks four of the small boats, and spills out the crews among the
      alligators. Unhappily, it is winter, and the alligators are sound asleep
      in the mud below, by which effect of the season the spilled ones are
      pulled aboard their sister boats with legs and arms intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being reorganized, and having enough of swivel war, the English fleet of
      small boats rush the six cockleshells, and after a fierce struggle, take
      them by weight of numbers. The English Captain Lockyer, following the
      fight, wipes the blood from his face, which has been scratched by a
      cutlass, and reports to Admiral Cockrane his success, and adds:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American loss is, killed and wounded, sixty; English, ninety-four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being masters of Lake Borgne, the English go about the landing of troops
      on Pine Island. The sixteen hundred first ashore are formed into an
      advance battalion and ordered forward. They go splashing through the
      swamps toward the river like so many muskrats, and in the wet, cold,
      dripping end crawl out on a narrow belt of sugar-cane stubble which
      bristles between the levee and the swamp from which they have emerged.
      Finding dry land under their feet, they cheer up a bit, and build fires to
      make comfortable their bivouac while waiting the coming of their comrades,
      still wallowing in the swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night descends, but finds those sixteen hundred of the English advance
      reasonably gay; for, while the present is distressing, their fellows by
      brigades will be with them in the morning, and they may then march on to
      sumptuous New Orleans, where&mdash;as goes their war word&mdash;theirs
      shall be the &ldquo;Beauty and Booty&rdquo; for which they have come so far. And so
      the chilled, starved sixteen hundred of that English advance hold out
      their benumbed hands to the fires, and console themselves with what the
      poet describes as &ldquo;The Pleasures of Anticipation.&rdquo; And in this instance,
      of course, the anticipations are sure of fulfillment, for what shall
      withstand them? The raw, cowardly militia of the country? Absurd!
    </p>
    <p>
      As confirmatory of this, a subaltern hands about a copy of the <i>London
      Sun</i> which has a description of Americans. The others peruse it by the
      light of their camp fires. It makes timely reading, since it is ever worth
      while to gather&mdash;so that they be reliable&mdash;what scraps one may
      descriptive of an enemy. The English, crouched about their fires, are much
      benefited by the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The American armies of Copper Captains and Falstaff recruits defy the
      pen of satire to paint them worse than they are&mdash;worthless, lying,
      treacherous, false, slanderous, cowardly, and vaporing heroes, with
      boasting on their loud tongues and terror in their quaking hearts. Were it
      not that the course of punishment they are to receive is necessary to the
      ends of moral and political justice, we declare before our country that we
      should feel ashamed of victory over such ignoble foes. The quarrel
      resembles one between a gentleman and a sweep&mdash;the former may beat
      the low scoundrel to his heart's content, but there is no honor in the
      exploit, and he is sure to be covered with the soil and dirt of his
      ignominious antagonist. But necessity will sometimes compel us to descend
      from our station to chastise a vagabond, and endure the degradation of
      such a contest in order to repress, by wholesome correction, the
      presumptuous insolence and mischievous designs of the basest assailant.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The young English officers find this refreshing as literature. It might
      have been less uplifting could they have foreseen how ninety years later
      England will fawn upon and flatter and wheedle America to the point which
      sickens, while her bankrupt nobility make that despised region a hunting
      ground where, equipped of a title and a coat of arms, they track heiresses
      to lairs of gold and marry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the satisfied English are asleep about their fires, it behooves
      one to hear how the General is faring. The day with him is one fraught
      with work. Word reaches him of the captured cockleshells on Lake Borgne.
      Also it reaches that valuable Legislature&mdash;honeycombed of treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Legislature sends a committee to ask the General what will be his
      course if he's beaten back. The General is hardly courteous:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your honorable body,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that if disaster overtake me and the
      fate of war drives me from my lines to the city, they may expect to have a
      very warm session.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Livingston catches the adjective. The committee having departed, he
      propounds a query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A warm session, General!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; replies the General, &ldquo;if I am beaten here, I shall fall back on the
      city, fire it, and fight it out in the flames! Nothing for the maintenance
      of the enemy shall be left. New Orleans destroyed, I shall occupy a
      position on the river above, cut off supplies, and, since I can't drive, I
      shall starve the English out of the country. There is this difference,
      Ned, between me and those fellows from the Legislature. They think only of
      the city and its safety. For my side, I'm not here to defend the city, but
      the nation at large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the heels of this, the Legislature whispers of surrendering Louisiana
      to the English by resolution. It is scarcely feasible as a plan, but it
      angers the General. He stations a guard at the door of the chamber and
      turns the members away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can dispense with your sessions,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;We have laws enough; our
      great need now is men and muskets at the front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patricians of the Legislature are scandalized as being shut out of
      their chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not tell you,&rdquo; cries the prophetic House Speaker, &ldquo;did I not tell
      you this fellow was a desperado, and would wage war like a savage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The members retire from the guarded doors, cursing the General under their
      breath. Their doorkeeper, a low, common person, is so struck by what the
      General has said anent men and muskets, that he gets a gun and joins that
      &ldquo;desperado.&rdquo; And wherefore no? Patriotism has been the mark of vulgar
      souls in every age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Coffee's hunting-shirt scouts come in and report the watch fires
      of those sixteen hundred of the English advance winking and blinking among
      the sugar stubble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the General, &ldquo;I've a mind to disturb their dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General dispatches word to Commodore Patterson to have the <i>Carolina</i>
      in readiness to act with his forces. Then he sends for the indispensable
      Coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee, we shall attack them to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise Coffee gives the grunt acquiescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Coffee!&rdquo; says the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      The council over, Colonel Coffee goes to turn out the troops. This is to
      be done softly, as a surprise is aimed at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now on the dread threshold of battle, Papa Plauche of the &ldquo;Fathers of
      Families&rdquo; is overcome. As the intrepid &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; fall into line, tears
      fill Papa Plauche's eyes, and he appeals to neighbor St. Geme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Frenchman!&rdquo; cries Papa Plauche, tossing his arms; &ldquo;I am a
      Frenchman, and do not fear to die! But, alas! mon St. Geme, I fear I have
      not the courage to lead the 'Fathers of Families' to slaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Papa Plauche!&rdquo; returns the good St. Geme, made wretched by the
      grief of his friend. &ldquo;Hush! Command yourself! Do not let the wild General
      hear you; he will not, with his coarse nature, understand such
      sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Roche, of the &ldquo;Fathers of Families,&rdquo; steps in front of his
      company. Striking his breast melodramatically, he sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant Roche, advance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Roche advances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Embrace me, brother!&rdquo; cries Captain Roche in broken utterances, &ldquo;embrace
      me! It is perhaps for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers Roche embrace, and the &ldquo;Fathers of Families&rdquo; are melted by
      the tableau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant Roche, return to your place!&rdquo; commands the devoted Captain
      Roche, and the sergeant, weeping, lapses into the ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunting-shirt men, witnesses of these touching scenes, are rude enough
      to laugh, and by way of parody embrace one another effusively. As they
      depart through the dark for their station, they break into whispered
      debate as to whether the theatrical grief of Papa Plauche, the brothers
      Roche, and the &ldquo;Fathers of Families&rdquo; is due to their creole blood, or
      their city breeding, either, according to the theories of the
      hunting-shirt men, being calculated to promote the effeminate in a man.
      While they thus wrangle, there comes an angry hissing whisper from Colonel
      Coffee, like the hiss of a serpent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every hunting-shirt man is stricken dumb. They move forward like shadows,
      right flank skirting the cypress swamp. To the far left they hear the
      moccasined, half-muffled tramp of Colonel Carroll's men&mdash;their
      hunting-shirt brothers from the Cumberland. As they turn a bend in the
      swamp, they see not a furlong away the flickering and shadow dancing of
      the watch fires of the tired English. At this every hunting-shirt man
      makes certain the flint is secure in the hammer of his rifle, and loosens
      the knife and tomahawk in his rawhide belt.

      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE BATTLE IN THE DARK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S the
      hunting-shirt men come within sight of the blinking lights, which
      polka-dot the sugar stubble in front and mark the bivouac of the English,
      Colonel Coffee sends the whispered word along the line to halt. At this,
      the hunting-shirt men crouch in the lee of the cypress swamp, and wait.
      Colonel Coffee is lying by for the signal which shall tell him to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the movement commences, the General calls Colonel Coffee to one of
      their celebrated conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my purpose, Coffee,&rdquo; explains the General, &ldquo;merely to shake them up
      a bit. An attack will cure them of overconfidence, and break the teeth of
      their conceit. This should hold them in check, and give us time for
      certain earthworks I meditate. The signal will be a gun from the <i>Carolina</i>.
      When you hear the gun, Coffee, attack everything wearing a red coat. But
      be careful!&rdquo; Here the General lifts a long, admonitory finger. &ldquo;Do not
      follow too far! Reinforcements are crawling out of the swamp to the rear
      of the English every hour, and the only certainty is that, even as we
      talk, they outnumber us two for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faithful Coffee departs. As he reaches the door, the General calls
      after him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget, Coffee! The gun from the <i>Carolina!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hunting-shirt men lie waiting by the cypress swamp. On their near left
      is Papa Plauche and his &ldquo;Fathers of Families.&rdquo; Beyond these is a half
      company of regulars, which the General has brought up from the near-by
      post. On the Bayou Road, between the regulars and the river, is the
      General himself, with a brace of small field pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a moonless night, and what light the stars might furnish is withheld
      by a blanket-screen of thick clouds. No night could be darker; for, lest
      an occasional star find a cloud-rift and peer through, a fog drifts up
      from the river. This is good for the English, since it hides their watch
      fires, which one by one are lost in the mists. The darkness deepens until
      even the hawk-eyed hunting-shirt men, trained by much night fighting to a
      nocturnal keenness of vision, are unable to make out their nearest
      comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pitch blackness, and the fog chill creeping over him, tell on Papa
      Plauche. He whispers sorrowfully to his friend St. Geme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neighbor St. Geme,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;these differences should be adjusted by
      argument, and not by deadly guns. I see that he who would either shoot or
      be shot by his fellow-man; is in an erroneous position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the kindly St. Geme may frame response, a liquid tongue of flame
      illuminates the broad dark bosom of the river. It is followed sharply by a
      crashing &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; This is the word from the <i>Carolina.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The signal carries dismay into the hearts of the English, since Commodore
      Patterson, whose genius is thoroughgoing, is at pains to load the gun with
      two pecks of slugs, and eighty-four killed and wounded are the red English
      harvest of that one discharge. The frightened drums beat the alarm, and
      the ranks of English form. As they grasp their arms the nine broadside
      guns of the Carolina begin to rake them. With this the English fall slowly
      back from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rearward movement, while managed slowly because of the darkness,
      brings discouraging results. The English retreat into the hunting-shirt
      men, who are skirmishing up from the cypress swamp. The English are first
      told of this new danger by the spitting flashes which remind them of
      needles of fire, and the crack of the long squirrel rifles like the
      snapping of a whip. Here and there, too, a groan is heard, as the
      sightless lead finds some English breast. This augments the blind horror
      of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trapped English reply in a desultory fashion, and make a bad matter
      worse. The hunting-shirt men locate them by the flash of their guns, at
      which they shoot with incredible quickness and accuracy. With men falling
      like November's leaves, the English give ground to the south, which saves
      them somewhat from both the <i>Carolina</i> and the hunting-shirt men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guessing the English direction, the hunting-shirt men follow, loading and
      firing as they advance. Now and then a hunting-shirt man overtakes an
      individual foe, and settles the national differences which divide them
      with tomahawk and knife. It is cruel work&mdash;this unseeing bloodshed in
      the dark, and disturbingly new to the English, who express their dislike
      for it.

    <p>
      While the hunting-shirt men drive the English along the fringe of the
      cypress swamp, the General, a half mile nearer the river, is working his
      two field pieces. Affairs proceed to his warlike satisfaction&mdash;and
      this is saying a deal for one so insatiate in matters of blood&mdash;until
      a flying ounce of lucky English lead wounds a horse on the number two gun.
      This brings present relief to those English in the General's front; for
      the hurt animal upsets the gun into the ditch. It takes fifteen minutes to
      put it on its proper wheels again. The accident disgruntles the General;
      but he bears it with what philosophy he may, and in good truth is pleased
      to find that the gun carriage has not been smashed in the upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save the gun!&rdquo; is his word to the artillery men; and when it is saved he
      praises them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the booming signal from the <i>Carolina</i>, the intrepid Papa Plauche
      cries out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forwards, brave Fathers of Families! Forwards, heroes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; respond, and go on with the hunting-shirt men. But their
      pace is sedate; and this last results in an impoliteness which disturbs
      the excellent Papa Plauche to the core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunting-shirt men are, for the major portion, riotous young blades
      from the backwoods. Moreover, they are used to this prowling warfare of
      the night. Is it wonder then that they advance more rapidly than does Papa
      Plauche with his &ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; whose step is measured and dignified as
      becomes the heads of households?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it befalls that, do their dignified best, Papa Plauche and his
      &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; are left behind by the hunting-shirt men, who, deploying more
      and still more to the left, extend themselves in front of Papa Plauche.
      This does not suit the latter's hardy tastes, and he frets ferociously. He
      grows condemnatory, as the spitting rifle flashes show him that the
      vainglorious hunting-shirt men are between him and those English whom he
      hungers to destroy. Indeed, he fumes like tiger cheated of its prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall extricate ourselves, neighbor St. Geme!&rdquo; cries Papa Plauche.
      &ldquo;We shall yet extricate ourselves! Behold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; is the foreword of certain masterly maneuvers by Papa
      Plauche among the sugar stubble. The maneuvers free the farseeing Papa
      Plauche and his &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; from those obstructive, unmannerly hunting-shirt
      men, who have cut off their advance even in its indomitable bud. The
      &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; being better used to shop floors than plowed fields, however,
      make difficult work of it. At last courage has its reward, and the
      &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; uncover their dauntless front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my brave St. Geme!&rdquo; cries Papa Plauche, when his strategy has put the
      hunting-shirt men on his right, where they belong, &ldquo;nothing can save the
      caitiff English now! Those ruffians in hunting tunics who protected them
      no longer impede our front. Forwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The final word has hardly issued from between the clenched teeth of Papa
      Plauche when a rustling in the stubble apprises him of the foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire, Fathers of Families, fire!&rdquo; shouts Papa Plauche, and such is the
      fury which consumes him that the shout is no shout, but a screech.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is enough! One by one each &ldquo;Father&rdquo; discharges his flintlock. The
      procession of reports is rather ragged, and now and again a considerable
      wait occurs between shots, like a great gap in a picket fence. Still, the
      last &ldquo;Father&rdquo; finally finds the trigger, and the command of Papa Plauche
      is obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; hurt no one by this savage volley, for their aim like their
      hearts is high. It is quite as well they do not. The stubble-disturbing
      force in front chances to be none other than that half company of
      regulars, to whose rear it seems the inadvertent Papa Plauche, in freeing
      them from the hunting-shirt men, has led his &ldquo;Fathers.&rdquo; The regulars are
      in a towering rage with Papa Plauche; but since no one has been injured,
      and Papa Plauche is profuse in his apologies, their anger presently
      subsides. The regulars again take up their bloody work upon the retreating
      English, while the discouraged Papa Plauche and the &ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; full of
      confusion and chagrin at twice being balked, remain where they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, neighbor St. Geme,&rdquo; observes Papa Plauche, &ldquo;the mistake was
      theirs. Did they not usurp the place which belonged to the English, in
      thus getting in front of us? It should teach them to beware how they put
      themselves in the path of my 'Fathers,' whose wrath is terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two black, sightless hours the huntingshirt men crowd the English to
      the south. Then the General draws them off. They come, bringing as
      captives one colonel, two majors, three captains, and sixty-four privates.
      Also they have killed and wounded two hundred and thirteen of the English,
      which comforts them marvelously. They themselves have suffered but
      slightly, and the backloads of English guns they carry will gladden many
      an unarmed Kentucky heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when he has them together, the beloved Coffee at their head, the
      General leads the way to the thither side of the Roderiquez Canal, where
      he plans a line of breastworks. Arriving, the weary hunting-shirt men
      build fires, and make themselves easy for the balance of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief rest, the thoughtful General detaches a party with one of
      the field guns, to interest the English until daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For I think, Coffee,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that if we keep them awake, they will be
      apt to sleep tomorrow; and so leave us free to work on our defenses.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV&mdash;COTTON BALES AND SUGAR CASKS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is the day
      before Christmas when the General lays out his line for fortifications.
      The Roderiquez Canal is no canal at all, but a disused mill race, which an
      active man can leap and any one may wade. The General will make a moat of
      it, and raise his breastworks along its mile-length muddy course, between
      the river and the cypress swamp. He keeps an army of mules and negroes,
      with scrapers and carts, hard at work, heaping up the earth. A boat load
      of cotton is lying at the levee. The cotton bales are rolled ashore, and
      added to the heaped-up earth. This pleases Papa Plauche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is singular,&rdquo; he remarks to neighbor St. Geme, &ldquo;that cotton, which has
      been my business support for years, should now defend my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a low place to the General's front. He cuts the levee; and soon
      the Mississippi furnishes three feet of water, to serve as a wet drawback
      to any English advance. The latter, however, are not thinking on an
      advance. Supports have come dripping from the swamp, and swollen their
      numbers to threefold the General's force; but none the less their hearts
      are weak. That horrifying night attack, when their blood was shed in the
      dark, has broken the heart of their vanity, and a paralyzing fear of those
      dangerous hunting-shirt men lies all across the English like a cloud. More
      and worse, the <i>Carolina</i> swings downstream, abreast of their
      position, and her broadsides drive them to hide in ditches and the cypress
      borders of the swamp. There is no peace, no safety, on the flat, stubble
      ground, while light remains by which to point the <i>Carolina's</i> guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor does nightfall bring relief. Those empty-handed Kentuckians must be
      provided for; and, no sooner does the sun go down, than the hunting-shirt
      men by two and three go forth in search of English muskets. They shoot
      down sentries, and carry away their dead belongings. Does an English group
      assemble round a camp fire, it becomes an invitation seldom neglected. A
      party of hunting-shirt men creep within range and begin the butchery.
      There is never the moment, daylight and dark, when the unhappy English are
      not within the icy reach of death. There is no repose, no safety! A chill
      dread claims them like a palsy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The English complain bitterly at this bushwhacking; which, to the
      hunting-shirt men, reared in schools of Indian war, is the merest A B C of
      battle. The harassed English denounce the General as a barbarian, in whose
      savage bosom burns no spark of chivalry. They recall how in their late
      campaigns in Spain, English and French pickets spent peace-filled weeks
      within fifty yards of one another, exchanging nothing more deadly than
      coffee and compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grim General refuses to be affected by the French-English example. He
      continues to pile up his earthworks, while the hunting-shirt men go forth
      to pot nightly English as usual. The situation wears away the courage of
      the English to a white and paper thinness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the General is fortifying his lines, and the hunting-shirt men are
      stalking English sentinels, peace is signed in Europe between America and
      England. But Europe is far away; and there is no Atlantic cable. And so
      the General continues at his congenial labors undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas does not go unrecognized in the General's camp. He himself
      attempts nothing of festival sort, and only drives his fortifying mules
      and negroes the harder. But the hunting-shirt men celebrate by cleaning
      their rifles, molding bullets, refilling powder horns, and whetting knives
      and tomahawks to a more lethal edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Papa Plauche and the &ldquo;Fathers of Families,&rdquo; they become jocund.
      Their wives and daughters purvey them roast fowls in little wicker
      baskets, and the warmest wines of Burgundy in bottles. Whereupon Papa
      Plauche and his &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; wax blithe and merry, singing the songs of
      France and talking of old loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Sir Edward Pakenham arrives, and relieves General Keane in command
      of the English. With him comes General Gibbs. The two listen to the
      reports of General Keane, and shrug polite shoulders as he speaks of the
      savage valor of the Americans. It is preposterous that peasants clad in
      skins, and not a bayonet among them, should check the flower of England.
      General Keane does not reply to the polite shrug. He reflects that the
      General, with his hunting-shirt men, can be relied upon to later make
      convincing answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the morning which follows the advent of General Pakenham, the English
      see a moment of good fortune. A red-hot shot sets fire to the <i>Carolina</i>,
      as she swings downstream on her cable for that daily bombardment, and
      burns her to the water line. This cheers the English mightily; and does
      not discourage Commodore Patterson, who transfers his activities to the
      decks of the <i>Louisiana.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward gives the General three uninterrupted days. This the latter
      warrior improves so far as to rear his earthworks to a height of four
      feet, and mount five guns. On the fourth day the English are led out to
      the assault. Sir Edward does not say so, but he expects to march over
      those four-foot walls of mud and cotton bales as he might over any other
      casual four-foot obstruction, and go up to the city beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sequel does not justify Sir Edward's optimism. The moment the English
      approach within two hundred yards of the General's line, a sheet of fire
      hisses all along. The English melt away like smoke. They break and run,
      seeking refuge in the cross ditches which drain the stubble lands. Once in
      the ditches, they are made to sit fast by the watchful hunting-shirt men,
      whose aim is death and who shoot at every exposed two square inches of
      English flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day the English must crouch in the saving mud and water of those
      ditches, and it ruffles their self-regard. With darkness for a shield, Sir
      Edward brings them off. He explains the disaster to his staff by calling
      it a &ldquo;reconnoissance.&rdquo; General Keane also calls it a &ldquo;reconnoissance&rdquo;; but
      there is a satisfied grin on his war-worn face. Sir Edward has received a
      taste of the mettle of those &ldquo;peasants,&rdquo; and may now take a more tolerant,
      and less politely cynical, view of what earlier setbacks were experienced
      by General Keane. As for the seventy dead who lie, faces to the quiet
      stars, among the sugar stubble, they say nothing. And whether it be called
      a &ldquo;reconnoissance&rdquo; or a defeat matters little to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; asks Sir Edward of his friend, General Gibbs,
      as the two confer over a bottle of port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Edward,&rdquo; returns the General, &ldquo;I should call a council of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward winces. It is too great an honor for the brother-in-law of Lord
      Wellington to pay a &ldquo;Copper Captain&rdquo; like the General. For all that he
      calls it; and the call assembles, besides Generals Gibbs and Keane, those
      saltwater soldiers, Admirals Cochrane, Codrington and Malcolm, and Captain
      Hardy whom Nelson loved. Sir John Burgoyne, the chief of the English
      engineers, is also there. The solemn debate lasts hours. The decision is
      to regard the General's position as &ldquo;A walled and fortified place, to be
      reduced by regular and formal approaches.&rdquo; Which is flattering to the
      General's engineering skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The council breaks up. The next morning Sir John Burgoyne commits a stroke
      of genius. He rolls out of the storehouses to the English rear countless
      hogsheads of sugar. Night sets in, foggy and black. Under its protecting
      cover, Sir John trundles his hundreds of hogsheads to a point not six
      hundred yards from the General's mud walls. Till daybreak the English
      work. They set the hogsheads on end&mdash;four close-packed thicknesses of
      them, two tier high. Ingenious portholes are left to receive the muzzles
      of the guns, and thirty cannon, which have been dragged through the
      cypress swamp from the fleet, are placed in position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those hogsheads of sugar, with the thirty black muzzles frowning forth,
      impress folk as a most formidable fortalice, when the upshooting sun rolls
      back the fog and offers a view of them. The General, however, does not
      hesitate; he instantly opens with his five, and the thirty guns of the
      English bellow their iron response. Hardly a whit behind the General, the
      active Commodore Patterson drops downstream with the <i>Louisiana</i>, and
      throws the weight of her broadsides against the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big-gun duel is hot and furious, and the rolling clouds of powder
      smoke shut out the fighters from one another. They do not pause for that,
      but fire blindly through the smoke, sighting their guns by guess. When the
      smoke has cloaked the scene, Sir Edward orders two columns of the English
      foot to storm the General's mud walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The columns advance, and run headforemost into the hunting-shirt men. The
      sleety rain of lead which greets them rolls the columns up like two red
      carpets. The recoiling columns break, and the English take cover for a
      second time in those saving ditches. They declare among themselves that
      mortal man might more easily face the fires of hell itself, than the
      flame-filled muzzles of the hunting-shirt men, who seem to be Death's very
      agents upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the broken English crouch in those ditches the fire of Sir John
      Burgoyne's big guns begins to falter. The smoke is so thick that no one
      may tell the cause. At last the English volleys altogether end, and the
      General orders Dominique and Bluche, with their swarthy pirate crews from
      Barrataria, and what other artillerists are serving his quintette of guns,
      to cease their stormy work. With that a silence falls on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breeze from the river tears the smoky veil aside; and lo! that noble
      fortification of sugar hogsheads is heaped and piled in ruins. The
      General's solid shot go through and through those hogsheads of sugar, as
      though they are hogsheads of snow. Five of the thirty English guns are
      smashed. The proud work of Sir John Burgoyne presents a spectacle of
      desolation, while the English who serve the batteries go flying for their
      lives. Not all! The three-score dead remain&mdash;the only English whose
      honor is saved that day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward's cheek is white as death. He blames Sir John Burgoyne, who has
      erred, he says, in constructing the works. Sir John did err, and Sir
      Edward is right. Forty years later, the same Sir John will repeat the same
      mistake at Sebastapol; which shows how there be Bourbons among the
      English, learning nothing, forgetting nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the English skulk in clusters, and ragged, beaten groups for their old
      position beyond the General's long reach, the fear of death is written on
      their faces. It will take a long rest, and much must be forgotten, e'er
      they may be brought front to front with the General again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the hunting-shirt men are exultation and crowing triumph. Only Papa
      Plauche is sad. During the fight, the cotton bales in front of Papa
      Plauche and the &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; are sorely knocked about. As though this be not
      enough, what must a felon hot shot do but set one of them ablaze! The
      smoke fills the noses of Papa Plauche and his &ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; and makes them
      sneeze. It burns their eyes until the tears the &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; shed might make
      one think them engaged upon the very funeral of Papa Plauche himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tearful sneezing midst of this anguish, a vagrant flying flake of
      cotton, all afire, explodes an ammunition wagon to the heroic rear of Papa
      Plauche and the &ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; and the shock is as the awful shock of doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortitude of Hercules would fail at such a pinch! Papa Plauche and the
      &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; actually and for the moment think on flight! But whither shall
      they fly? They are caught between Satan and a deepest sea&mdash;the
      ammunition wagon and the English! Also to the right, plying sponge and
      rammer, are the pirate Barratarians who are as bad as the English! While
      to the left is the General, who is worse than the ammunition wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is written!&rdquo; murmurs Papa Plauche; &ldquo;our fate is sure! We must perish
      where we stand!&rdquo; Papa Plauche extends his hands, and cries: &ldquo;Courage, my
      heroes! Give your hearts to heaven, your fame to posterity, and show
      history how 'Fathers of Families' can die!&rdquo; From the cypress swamp a last
      detachment of reënforcements emerges, and meets the beaten English coming
      back. General Lambert, with the reënforcements, is shocked as he reads
      their broken-hearted story in their eyes. &ldquo;What is it, Colonel?&rdquo; he
      whispers to Colonel Dale of the Highlanders. &ldquo;In heaven's name, what
      stopped you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bullets, mon!&rdquo; returns the Scotchman. &ldquo;Naught but bullets! The fire of
      those de'ils in lang shirts wud 'a' stopped Caesar himsel'!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE EIGHTH OF JANUARY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ACK to his negroes
      and mules and carts and scrapers goes the General, and sets them to
      renewed hard labor on those immortal mud walls which he will never get too
      high. Those cotton bales, so distressing to Papa Plauche and the
      &ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; are eliminated, at which that paternal commander breathes
      freer. The hunting-shirt men, with each going down of the sun, resume
      their nighthawk parties, which swoop upon English sentinels, taking lives
      and guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English themselves are a prey to dejection. The foe against whom they
      war is so strange, so savage, so sleepless, so coldly inveterate! Also
      those incessant night attacks sap their manhood. They build no fires now,
      but sit in darkness through the nights. A fire is but the attractive
      prelude to a shower of nocturnal lead, and the woefully lengthening list
      of dead and wounded tells strongly against it. To even light a cigar after
      dark is an approach to suicide; and so the English wrap themselves in
      blackness&mdash;very miserable! Their earlier horror of the hunting-shirt
      men is increased; for they have three times studied backwoods marksmanship
      from the standpoint of targets, and the dumb chill about their heart-roots
      is a testimony to its awful accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, who reads humanity as astronomers read the heavens, is not
      wanting in notions of the gloom which envelops the English like a funeral
      pall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; says he, at one of those famous war councils of two, &ldquo;in their
      souls we have them beaten. They will fight again; but only from pride.
      Their hope is gone, Coffee; we have broken their hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reports of the General's scouts teach him that the English will put a
      force across the river. In anticipation, he dispatches Commodore
      Patterson, with a mixed command of soldiers and sailors, to fortify the
      west bank. Commodore Patterson emulates the General's four-foot mud walls
      and throws up a redoubt of his own, mounting thereon twelve
      eighteen-pounders taken from the Louisiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tries one on the English opposite. The result is gratifying; the gum
      pitches a solid shot all across the Mississippi and into the English
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight days pass by in Indian file, and Sir Edward Pakenham with his
      English feels that, for his safety as much as his honor, he must attack
      the General, whose mud walls increase with each new sunset. The General
      foresees this, and has reports of Sir Edward's movements brought him every
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the eighth the General's scouts wake him at two o'clock
      and say that the English are astir. He is instantly abroad; the word goes
      down the line; by four o'clock every rifle is ready, each hunting-shirt
      man at his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weak spot, the one at which Sir Edward will level his utmost force, is
      where the General's line finds an end in the moss-hung cypress swamp. It
      is there he stations the reliable Coffee with his hunting-shirt men. To
      the rear, as a reserve, is General Adair with what Kentuckians the good,
      unerring offices of those night-prowling hunting-shirt men have armed at
      the red expense of the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the center is the redoubtable Papa Plauche and his &ldquo;Fathers.&rdquo; The
      &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; are between the pirates Dominique and Bluche and Captain
      Humphries of the regular artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa Plauche is rejoiced at being thus thrust into the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my heroes!&rdquo; cries Papa Plauche, in a speech which he makes the
      &ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; the center is the heart&mdash;the home of honor! &ldquo;On us, my
      Fathers, devolves the main defense of our beloved city, where sleep our
      wives and children. Wherefore, be brave as vigilant&mdash;vigilant as
      brave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Papa Plauche's voice is husky, but not from fear. No, it is husky by
      reason of a cold which, despite certain woolen nightcaps wherewith the
      excellent Madam Plauche equipped him for the field, he has contracted in
      sleeping damply among the stubble and the river fogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six hundred yards in front of the General's mud walls, and near the river,
      are a huddle of plantation buildings. The English, he argues, will mask a
      part of their advance with these structures. The forethoughtful General
      prepares for this, and has furnaces heating shot, to set those buildings
      blazing at the psychological moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, in response to a comic cynicism not usual with him, he has out the
      brass band of Papa Plauche, with instructions to strike up &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo;
       as the first gun is fired. The band, in compliment to the General, has
      been privily rehearsing &ldquo;'Possum up a Gum Tree,&rdquo; which it understands is
      the national anthem of Tennessee, and offers to play that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General thanks the band, but declines &ldquo;'Possum up a Gum Tree.&rdquo; It will
      not be understood by the English; whereas &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo; they have known
      and loathed for forty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give 'em 'Yankee Doodle,'&rdquo; says the General. &ldquo;Since they are so eager to
      dance, we'll furnish the proper music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward is as soon afoot as is the General. He finds his English steady
      yet dull; they will fight, but not with spirit. As the General assured the
      conferring Coffee, the hunting-shirt men, with their long rifles like
      wands of death, have broken the English heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English are to advance in three columns; General Keane on the right
      with Rennie's Rifles, in the center Dale's Highlanders, on the left, where
      the main attack is to be launched, General Gibbs, with three thousand of
      the pride of England at his back. General Lambert is to hold himself in
      the rear of General Gibbs, with two regiments as a reserve. As the columns
      form, there are eighty-five hundred of the English; against which
      the-General opposes a scanty thirty-two hundred. And yet, upon those
      overpowering eighty-five hundred hangs a silence like a sadness, as though
      they are about to go marching to their graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn fear in which the English hold the hunting-shirt men finds
      pathetic evidence. As the columns wheel into position, Colonel Dale of the
      Highlanders gives a letter and his watch to the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry them to my wife,&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll peel for no American!&rdquo; and twenty-four hours later he is buried in
      that cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English stand to their arms, and wait the breaking of day. Slowly the
      minutes drag their leaden length along; morning comes at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first streaks of livid dawn, a Congreve rocket flashes skyward
      from Sir Edward's headquarters. The rocket is the English signal to
      advance. In a moment, General Gibbs, General Keane, and Colonel Dale with
      his &ldquo;praying&rdquo; Highlanders are in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signal rocket uncouples thousands upon thousands of fellow rockets;
      the air is on fire with them as they blaze aloft in mighty arcs, to fall
      and explode among the hunting-shirt men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toys for children, boys,&rdquo; cries the General, as he observes the
      hunting-shirt men watching the flaming shower with curious,
      non-understanding eyes; &ldquo;toys for children! They'll hurt no one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General is right. Those congreve rockets are supposed to be as deadly
      as artillery. Like many another commodity of war, however, meant primarily
      to fatten contractors, they prove as innocuous as so many huge fireflies.
      The hunting-shirt men laugh at them. The battery of eighteen-pounders,
      wherewith the English second that flight of rockets, is a more serious
      affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sun shoots up above the cypress swamp and rolls back the mists of
      morning, the English make a gallant picture. The dull yellow of the
      stubble in front of the General's line is gay with splotches of red and
      gray and green and tartan, the colors of the various English corps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunting-shirt men, however, are not given much space for admiration;
      for, with one grand crash, the big guns go into action and the
      red-green-gray-tartan picture is swallowed up in powder smoke. Also, it is
      now that Papa Plauche's band blares forth &ldquo;Yankee Doodle,&rdquo; while those
      anticipatory hot shot set fire to the plantation buildings. As the latter
      burst out at door and window in smoke and flames, Colonel Rennie and his
      riflemen are driven into the open. The conflagration gets much in the
      English way, and spoils the drill-room nicety of Sir Edward's onset as he
      has it planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Rennie, being capable of brisk decision, makes the best of a
      disconcerting situation. When the flames and smoke from those fired
      plantation buildings drive him into the open before he is ready, he
      promptly orders a charge. This his riflemen obey; for the inexorable
      Patterson, across the river, is already upon them with those
      eighteen-pounders, and his solid shot are mowing ghastly swaths through
      the rifle-green ranks, tossing dead men in the air like old bags. With so
      little inducement to stand still, the riflemen hail that word to charge as
      a relief, and head for the General's mud walls at double quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oncoming Colonel Rennie and his English are met full in the face by a
      tempest of grape, from Major Humphrey and the pirates Dominique and
      Bluche, which throws them backward upon themselves. They bunch up and clot
      into lumps of disorder, like clumps of demoralized sheep in rifle-green.
      At that, Commodore Patterson serves his eighteen-pounders with multiplied
      speed, and the great balls tear those sheep-clumps to pieces, staining
      with crimson the rifle-green. The English marvel at the artillery work of
      the General's men, whose every shot comes on, well aimed and low, bringing
      death in its whistling wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      They should reflect: The theory, not to say the eye, which aims a squirrel
      rifle will point a cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Rennie, when his English recoil, keeps on&mdash;face red with
      grief and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my time to die!&rdquo; says he to Captain Henry. &ldquo;But before I die, I
      shall at least see the inside of those mud walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Rennie is wrong. A bullet finds his brain as he lifts his head
      above the breastworks, and he slips back dead in the ditch outside. Major
      King and Captain Henry die with him, pierced each by a handful of bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the English flinch and Colonel Rennie falls, the bugler&mdash;a boy
      of fourteen&mdash;climbs a tree, not one hundred yards from the General's
      line. Perched among the branches, he sounds his dauntless charges. The
      General gives orders to let the boy alone. And so the little bugler,
      protected by the word of the General, sings his shrill onsets to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally an artillery-man goes out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down, my son!&rdquo; says the cannoneer. &ldquo;The war's about over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little bugler comes down, and is at once taken to the fatherly heart
      of Papa Plauche, who declares him to be a sucking Hector, and is for
      adopting him as his son on the spot, but is restrained by thoughts of
      Madam Plauche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward's main assault, with General Gibbs, meets no fairer fortune
      than falls to Colonel Rennie by the river. Confusion prevails on the
      threshold of the movement; for Colonel Mullins with his Forty-fourth
      refuses to go forward. Later he will be courtmartialed, and dismissed in
      disgrace. Just now, however, the recreant makes a shameful tangle of the
      English van. As a quickest method of setting the tangle straight, General
      Gibbs, as did Colonel Rennie, orders a charge. The column moves forward,
      the mutinous Forty-fourth on the right flank, led by its major.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Gibbs advances, brushing with the shoulder of his corps, the
      cypress swamp. Behind the mud walls in his front, the steady hunting-shirt
      men are waiting. The General is there, to give the latter patience and
      hold them in even check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, boys!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Remember your ranges! Don't fire until they are
      within two hundred yards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On rush the English. At six hundred yards they are met by the fire of the
      artillery. They heed it not, but press sullenly forward, closing up the
      gaps in their ranks, where the solid shot go crashing through, as fast as
      made. Five hundred yards, four hundred, three hundred! Still they come!
      Two hundred yards!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the hunting-shirt men! A line of fire unending glances from right
      to left and left to right, along the crest of those mud walls, and Death
      begins his reaping. The head of the English column burns away, as though
      thrust into a furnace! The column wavers and welters like a red ship in a
      murky sea of smoke! It pauses, falteringly&mdash;disdaining to fly, yet
      unable to advance!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward, men!&rdquo; shouts General Gibbs. &ldquo;This is the way you should go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he points with his sword to those terrible mud walls, he falls riddled
      by the hunting-shirt men.

      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE SLAUGHTER AMONG THE STUBBLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN the main
      advance begins, Sir Edward is in the center with the Highlanders. The
      latter are not to move until he has word of their success from General
      Keane with Rennie's rifle corps, and General Gibbs with the main column&mdash;the
      one by the river and the other by the cypress swamp. He has not long to
      wait; a courier dashes up from the river&mdash;eye haggard, disorder in
      his look!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Keane?&rdquo; cries Sir Edward, his apprehension on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fallen!&rdquo; returns the courier hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rennie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead. The Rifles are in full retreat!&rdquo; Sir Edward stands like one
      stricken. Then he pulls himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring on your Highlanders!&rdquo; he cries to Colonel Dale. &ldquo;We must force
      their lines in front of General Gibbs. It is our only chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward dashes across to General Gibbs, in the shadow of that
      significant cypress swamp. He sees General Gibbs go down! He sees the red
      column torn and twisted by that storm of lead which the hunting-shirt men
      unloose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the English reel away from those low-flying messengers of death, Sir
      Edward seeks to rally them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Englishmen?&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Have you but marched upon a battlefield
      to stain the glory of your flag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Edward's gesticulating arm falls, smashed by a bullet from some
      sharp-shooting hunting-shirt man. He seems not to know his hurt! He is on
      fire with the thought that those honors, won upon forty fields, are to be
      wrested from him by a &ldquo;Copper Captain,&rdquo; backed by a mob of peasants in
      buckskin! He rushes among the shaken English to check the panic which is
      seizing them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Highlanders come up!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! brave Highlanders!&rdquo; he shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Sir Edward's welcoming shout, Colonel Dale waves a salute! It is his
      last; the huntingshirt men are upon him with those unerring rifles, and he
      falls dead before his General's eyes. Coincident with the fall of his
      beloved Dale, Sir Edward is struck by a second bullet. It enters near the
      heart. As his aide catches him in his arms, he beckons feebly to Sir John
      Tylden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call up Lambert with the reserves!&rdquo; he whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he lies supported in the arms of his aide, a third bullet puffs out his
      lamp of life, and England loses a second Sir Philip Sidney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main column falls into renewed disorder! It begins to retreat; the
      retreat becomes a rout! Only the Highlanders stay! They cannot go forward;
      they will not go back! There they stand rooted, until five hundred and
      forty of their nine hundred and fifty are shot down.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the main column breaks, Major Wilkinson turns to Lieutenant Lavack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too much disgrace to take home!&rdquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Colonel Rennie, a mile away by the river, Major Wilkinson charges the
      mud walls. Lieutenant Lavack, sharing his feelings, shares with him that
      desperate, disgrace-defying charge. Through the singing, droning &ldquo;zip!
      zip!&rdquo; of the bullets, they press on! They reach the ditch, and splash
      through! Up the mud walls they swarm! Major Wilkinson falls inside, dead,
      three times shot through and through! Lieutenant Lavack, with a luck that
      is like a charm, lands in the midst of the hunting-shirt men without a
      scratch! They receive him hilariously, offer whisky and compliments, and
      assure him that they like his style. Lieutenant Lavack accepts the whisky
      and the compliments, and gains distinction as the one live Englishman over
      the General's mud walls this January day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field is swept of hostile English; all is silent in front, and not a
      shot is heard. Now when the firing is wholly on one side, the General
      passes the word for the hunting-shirt men to cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard-working Coffee comes up, face a-smudge of powder stains; for he
      has been taking his turn with a rifle, like any other hunting-shirt man.
      He finds the General as drunk on battle as some folk are on brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't beat us, Coffee!&rdquo; cries the General, wringing his friend's big
      hand. &ldquo;By the living Eternal they can't beat us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General unslings his ramshackle telescope, and leaps upon the mud
      walls for a survey of the field. The less curious Coffee devotes himself
      to wiping the sweat and powder smudges from his face. His impromptu toilet
      results only in unhappy smears, which make him resemble an overgrown
      sweep. He looks at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharp, short work!&rdquo; he mutters, as he notes that they have been fighting
      but twenty-five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0235.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Those plantation buildings are still blazing, no more than half-burned
      down, and the smoke hides the scene toward the river. The General turns
      his ramshackle spyglass upon his immediate front. The ground is fairly
      carpeted with dead English. As he gazes he calls to Colonel Coffee, who is
      now broadening the powder smears ingeniously with the sleeve of his
      hunting shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump up here, Coffee!&rdquo; cries the General. &ldquo;It's like resurrection day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus urged, Colonel Coffee abandons his attempts to improve his looks, and
      joins the General on the mud walls. He is in time to behold four hundred
      odd Highlanders scramble to their brogues among those five hundred and
      forty who will never march again, and come forward to surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been a hot and bloody morning. Of those six thousand whom Sir
      Edward takes into action&mdash;for the reserves with General Lambert are
      never within range&mdash;over twenty-one hundred are fallen. Seven hundred
      and thirty are killed as they stand in their ranks; and of the fourteen
      hundred marked &ldquo;wounded,&rdquo; more than six hundred are to die within the
      week. Among the twenty-one hundred killed and wounded, sixteen hundred go
      to swell the red record of the dire hunting-shirt men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two attacks, being at the ends of the General's lines, involve no more
      than two-thirds of his thirty-two hundred. Papa Plauche's &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; in the
      center, as well as General Adair's Kentuckians who act as reserves, are
      merest spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      That his &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; are not called upon to fire a shot, in no wise
      depresses Papa Plauche. He harangues his brave followers, and eloquently
      explains:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because of your sanguinary fame, my heroes!&rdquo; vociferates Papa
      Plauche. &ldquo;The English knew your position, and avoided you. They went as
      far to the right and to the left as they could, to escape that destruction
      you else would have infallibly meted out to them. Ah! my 'Fathers,' see
      what it is to have a terrible name! You must sit idle in battle, because
      no foe dare engage you! Be comforted, my glorious heroes! Achilles could
      have done no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Coffee, still busy with the powder smears, calls the General's
      attention to an English group of three, made up of a colonel, a bugler,
      and a soldier bearing a white flag. The trio halt six hundred respectful
      yards away. The bugler sounds a fanfare; the soldier waves his white flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General dispatches Colonel Butler with two captains to receive their
      message. It is a note signed &ldquo;Lambert,&rdquo; asking an armistice of twenty-four
      hours to bury the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Lambert?&rdquo; asks the General, and sends to the English colonel, with
      his bugler and white flag, to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three presently return; this time the note is signed &ldquo;John Lambert,
      Commander-in-Chief.&rdquo; The alteration proves to the General's liking, and
      the armistice is arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seven hundred and thirty dead English are buried where they fell.
      Thereafter the superstitious blacks will defy lash and torture rather than
      plow the land where they lie. It will raise no more sugar cane; but in
      time a cypress grove will sorrowfully cover it, as though in mournful
      memory of those who sleep beneath. The General carries his own dead to the
      city. They are not many, four dead and four wounded being the limit of his
      loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Lambert and the beaten English go wallowing, hip-deep, through the
      swamps to their boats. They will not fight again. The booming of the
      batteries, or mayhap the unusual warmth of the sun, has roused from their
      winter beds a scaly host of alligators. These saurians uplift their
      hideous heads and gaze sleepily, yet inquisitively, at the wallowing
      retreating English. Now and then one widely yawns, and the spectacle sends
      an icy thrill along what English spines bear witness to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end the beaten English are all departed. That tremendous invasion
      which, with &ldquo;Beauty and Booty!&rdquo; for its cry, sailed out of Negril Bay six
      weeks before to the sack of New Orleans, is abandoned, and the last
      defeated man jack once more aboard the ships and mighty glad to be there.
      The fleet sails south and east; but not until the tallest ship is hull
      down in the horizon does the General march into New Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General cannot bring himself to believe that the retreat of the
      English is genuine. They have still, as they sail away, full thirteen
      thousand fighting men aboard those ships, with a round one thousand
      cannon, and munitions and provisions for a year's campaign. He judges them
      by himself, and will not be convinced that they have fled. With this on
      his mind, he plants his pickets far and wide, and insists on double
      vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when fear of the English is rolled like a stone from their breasts,
      the folk of New Orleans fret under the General's iron rule. With that the
      prudent General tightens his grip. Even so excellent a soldier as Papa
      Plauche complains. He says that the hearts of the &ldquo;Fathers of Families&rdquo;
       are bursting with victory. His valiant &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; burn to express their
      joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General suggests that the joy-swollen &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; repair to the
      Cathedral, and hear the Abbé Duborg conduct a <i>Te Deum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa Plauche points out that, while a <i>Te Deum</i> is all very well in
      its way, it is a rite and not a festival. What his &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo;&mdash;who are
      thunderbolts of war!&mdash;desire is to give a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General says that he has no objections to the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa Plauche explains that a ball is not possible, with the city held fast
      in the controlling coils of military law. The rule that all lights must be
      out at nine o'clock, of itself forbids a ball. As affairs stand the
      &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; are helpless in their happiness. No one may dance by daylight;
      that would be too fantastic, too bizarre! And yet who, pray, can rejoice
      in the dark? It is against human nature, argues Papa Plauche.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General refuses to be moved; but continues to hold the city in his
      unrelenting clutch&mdash;maintaining the while a wary eye for sly
      returning English, with an occasional glance at the local treason which is
      simmering about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public murmur grows louder and deeper. A rumor of the peace comes
      ashore, no one knows how. The General refuses the rumor, fearing an
      English ruse to throw him off his guard. At the peace whisper, the popular
      discontent increases. The General, in the teeth of it, remains unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizen Hollander expresses himself with more heat than prudence. The
      General locks up the vituperative Citizen Hollander. M. Toussand, Consul
      for France, considers such action high-handed; and says so. The General
      marches Consul Toussand out of town, with a brace of bayonets at the
      consular back. Legislator Louaillier protests against the casting out of
      Consul Toussand. The General consigns the protesting Legislator Louaillier
      to a cell in the calaboose. Jurist Hall of the District Court issues a
      writ of habeas corpus for the relief and release of the captive
      Louaillier. The General responds by arresting Jurist Hall, who is given a
      cell between captives Louaillier and Hollander, where by raising his voice
      he may condole with them through the intervening stone walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus are affairs arranged when official notice of the peace reaches the
      General from Washington. Instantly he withdraws his grip from the city,
      restores the civil rule, and releases from captivity Jurist Hall, Citizen
      Hollander, and Legislator Louaillier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the disappearance of martial law, Papa Plauche, with his immortal
      &ldquo;Fathers of Families,&rdquo; gives that ball of victory, the exiled Consul
      Toussand creeps back into town, while Jurist Hall signalizes his
      restoration to the woolsack by fining the General one thousand dollars for
      contempt of court&mdash;which he pays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Legislature, guards withdrawn from its treasonable doors, expands into
      lawmaking. Its earliest action is a resolution of thanks for their brave
      defense of the city to officers Coffee, Carroll, Hinds, Adair, and
      Patterson. The Legislature pointedly does not thank the General, who grins
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Coffee, upon receiving the vote of thanks, writes a letter of
      acknowledgment, in which he intimates his opinions of the General, the
      Legislature, and himself. This missive is a remarkable outburst on the
      part of Colonel Coffee, who fights more easily than he writes, and shows
      how he is stirred to his hunting-shirt depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the clouds of pestiferous jurists and treason-hatching legislators
      descends a grand burst of sunshine. The blooming Rachel, as unlooked for
      as an angel, joins her gaunt hero in New Orleans, and the General forgets
      alike his triumphs and his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa Plauche&mdash;foremost in peace as in war&mdash;at once seizes on the
      advent of the blooming Rachel to give another ball. The whole city attends
      the function; the heroic &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; in full panoply and very splendid. The
      band plays &ldquo;'Possum up a Gum Tree,&rdquo; in the execution whereof it soars to
      vainest heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa Plauche dances with the blooming Rachel. The General unbuckles in
      certain intricate breakdowns, with which he challenged admiration in those
      days long ago when he was the beau of old Salisbury and read law with
      Spruce McCay. The &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; are not only edified but excited by the
      General's dancing; for he dances as he fights, violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Coffee, not being a dancing man, goes looking about him. He
      discovers a flower-piece, prepared by Papa Plauche, that is like unto a
      piece of flattery, and spells &ldquo;Jackson and Victory!&rdquo; in deepest red and
      green. He shows it to the General, who suggests that if Papa Plauche had
      made it &ldquo;Hickory and Victory!&rdquo; it would mean the same, and save the
      euphony.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the blooming Rachel, the General, the non-dancing Coffee, and the
      ardent Papa Plauche, with the beauty and chivalry of New Orleans about
      them, are at the ball, Colonel Burr, gray and bent and cynical, is talking
      with his friend Swartwout in far-away New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a glorious, a most convincing victory!&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Swartwout.
      &ldquo;President Madison cannot do the General too much honor. He has saved the
      country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has saved,&rdquo; returns the ironical Colonel Burr, &ldquo;what President Madison
      holds in much greater esteem. He has saved the Madison administration!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;ODDS AND ENDS OF TIME
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE General, the
      blooming Rachel by his side, takes up his homeward journey. Now when they
      are on their way and a world has time to observe them, it is to be noted
      that changes have befallen with the lengthened flight of time. The eye of
      the blooming Rachel is as liquidly black and deep, her hair as raven-blue,
      her cheek as round as on a rearward day when she won the heart of that
      bottle-green beau from old Salisbury. The alteration is in her form, which
      has grown plump and full and stout in these her matronly middle years. As
      to the bottle-green beau, his sandy hair is deeply shot with iron-gray,
      while his features show haggard, and seamed of care. To the inquiring eye
      he looks at once dangerous and rusty, like an old sword. His form, always
      spare, is more emaciated than ever. The last is due in part to those
      Benton bullets, and the Dickinson shot fired in that poplar, May-sweet
      wood on a certain Kentucky morning. Besides, one is not to forget those
      southern swamps, which have never had fame for building a man up. As the
      General, with his blooming Rachel, draws near home, the whole Cumberland
      country rushes forth to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that earliest day when Time began swinging his scythe in the meadows
      of humanity, mankind has owned but two ways of honoring a hero. One is the
      &ldquo;parade,&rdquo; the other is the &ldquo;dinner.&rdquo; In the one instance, half the people
      march in the middle of the street, while the remaining half line the curbs
      and look on. In the other, which has the merit of exclusion, a select
      great few set a board with meat and drink; and then, installing the hero
      where all may see, they bombard him with toasts and speeches and applause.
      All attend the &ldquo;parade&rdquo; since it is free. Few avoid the dinner, because,
      besides the honor and the honoring, it affords lawful occasion for being
      drunk&mdash;a manifest advantage to many in a strait-laced community. The
      General when he arrives in Nashville is exhaustively &ldquo;paraded&rdquo; and deeply
      &ldquo;dined.&rdquo; Also he is given a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, having been &ldquo;paraded&rdquo; and &ldquo;dined,&rdquo; and with honors thick upon him,
      the General sets about his duties as a major general in days of peace.
      General Adair and he have a letter-quarrel concerning the courage of
      Kentuckians. General Scott and he have a letter-quarrel on grounds more
      personal. As the upshot of the latter correspondence, the General evinces
      an eagerness to shoot his over-epauletted opponent at ten paces, oiling up
      the saw-handles to that hopeful end, but is balked by the over-epauletted
      one, who declines on grounds of piety and patriotism.

    </h5>
    <p>
      While the General is fuming with ink and paper against those distinguished
      warriors, he cools at intervals sufficiently to build the blooming Rachel
      a little church. The blooming Rachel is a devout Presbyterian; and, while
      the General is far too busy with this world to think much on the next, she
      prevails with him&mdash;for he never says &ldquo;No&rdquo; to her&mdash;to put her up
      a church. It is not much bigger than a drygoods box; but there are forty
      pews, besides a pulpit for Parson Blackburn, and the blooming Rachel is
      supremely happy. She owns to some illogical impression that, should the
      General build a church, he'll &ldquo;join.&rdquo; In this she goes wrong; for the
      General only builds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General mounts his horse, and rides to Washington. He meets Mr.
      Jefferson in Lynchburg, and that aged fine gentleman and maker of
      constitutions is struck by the graceful manners of the General, who has
      become all ease and polish where once he was as rough as a woods' colt. In
      Washington he is much feted and feasted, and the trump of celebration is
      tireless to sound his name. He gets back home in time to put a roof on the
      blooming Rachel's almost finished church, and listen to Parson Blackburn's
      dedicatory sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Red Stick Creeks from across the Florida line take to marauding and
      murdering in Southern Georgia, and the General decides to see about it. He
      sends an officer, with a force of men, to reduce Negro Fort on the
      Appalachicola. In giving that officer his instructions, the General
      expands touching the military virtues of red-hot shots; and with such
      satisfactory results that the first one fired at Negro Fort blows it to
      ruins, and with it three hundred and thirty-one of the three hundred and
      thirty-four blacks and reds who infest it. Three crawl from the blazing
      chaos, to be hilariously knocked on the head by friendly Creeks, who have
      attended the expedition with that fond hope and purpose. The world is much
      rejoiced at the demolition of Negro Fort; since murder and pillage have
      been the one business of its robber garrison, and the fire-torture of
      prisoners their one amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General presently appears at the head of his hunting-shirt men, and
      destroys the village of Chief Billy Bowlegs on the oft-sung Suwannee
      River. Then he takes St. Marks from the feeble Spaniards, and arrests a
      brace of conspiring English, Ambrister and Arbuthnot. The arrested ones
      have come across from the Bahamas, bringing English guns and lead and
      powder and promises to the hostile blacks and reds; and all in accordance
      with that policy, dear to England, of preferring bloodshed by proxy to
      shedding blood herself. The General hangs conspirator Arbuthnot, and
      shoots conspirator Ambrister; while England, in accordance with a second
      policy as dear as the first, disavows them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General goes on to Pensacola. Here he hauls down the flag of Spain,
      runs up the stars and stripes, drives out the Spanish Governor, and
      installs one of his own with a garrison to back him. Having executed
      conspirators Ambrister and Arbuthnot, he now seizes on two Creek-Seminole
      chiefs and hangs them, to preserve, so to speak, a racial equilibrium.
      Having thus wound up the Spanish, the English, the negroes and the Indians
      in Florida, the General returns to his home, serene in the sense of duty
      well performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's serenity is misplaced; trouble breaks out in Washington. Mr.
      Monroe is President, and Statesmen Clay and Crawford and Calhoun and Adams
      desire to be. The quartette last named suspect in the General&mdash;about
      whom a responsive public is running mad&mdash;a growing rival. They decide
      to cripple him in the very cradle of his White House prospects. If they do
      not he may grow up to snatch from them the crown. Moved of this high
      thought, they charge the General with waging unauthorized war; and with
      invading Spanish territory, we at peace with Spain. They call him a
      &ldquo;murderer&rdquo; for snuffing out conspirators Ambrister and Arbuthnot and those
      superfluous Creek-Seminole chiefs. Also, giving a moral snuffle, they
      demand that he be courtmartialed and cashiered.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Monroe shakes his head at the conniving quartette, replying as
      on a somewhat similar occasion did the Russian Catherine:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never punish conquerors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General by the Cumberland hears of these weird doings in Washington,
      and again rides over the mountains. His object is to discover, by personal
      observation, who in his case, are the sheep and who the goats, and
      separate in his own mind his friends from his enemies. Upon his arrival
      the General finds himself an issue of politics. As such he is voted upon
      by Congress, which affirms heavily in his favor. The people have long ago
      decided in his favor; and Congress, ever quick to locate the butter on its
      bread, sharply follows the popular example. Statesman Clay and others
      among the General's foes express themselves freely to his disadvantage.
      However, the General expresses himself freely to their disadvantage, and
      profound judges of vituperation say that he has the sulphurous best of the
      exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being upheld by Congress, and having freed his mind touching his foes, the
      General goes to Baltimore and Philadelphia, and is extravagantly wined and
      dined. Then he proceeds to New York, where Fitz Greene Halleck and Joseph
      Rodman Drake write doggerel at him in the <i>Evening Post</i>; and where,
      also, he is &ldquo;paraded&rdquo; and &ldquo;dinner&rdquo;&mdash;honored to a degree which lays all
      former &ldquo;parading&rdquo; and &ldquo;dinner&rdquo;&mdash;honoring, by less fervent communities, deep
      within the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spain cedes Florida to the United States; just as she would cede a bad hot
      penny that, besides being worthless, is burning her fingers. The President
      appoints the General governor of the new domain. Whereupon the new
      Governor lays down his Major General's commission, bids farewell to the
      army, and journeys south. He does not relish being Governor; and, after
      locking up his Spanish predecessor for stealing divers papers of state,
      and expatriating a scandalous bevy whose talk sounds like treason to his
      sensitive ear, he resigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the General gets back to the Cumberland country, he finds that his
      former quartermaster, Major Lewis, has decided to send him to the White
      House. The General is mightily taken aback, and declares himself unfit.
      Major Lewis retorts that he is far more fit than any of his quartette of
      Washington enemies, laying especial emphasis on Statesman Clay. The
      accurate force of the retort strikes the General wordless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Lewis is rich, wise, cunning, cool, college-bred, and eighteen years
      younger than the General. He is a born manager, a natural wire-puller, and
      can play politics by ear as some folk play the fiddle. Congenitally a
      Warwick, he prefers making a President to being one, and would sooner hold
      a baby than hold an office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Lewis seizes on the General as so much raw material wherefrom to
      construct a President. As a best method of having his man on the ground,
      he gives a hint, and the Tennessee Legislature sends the General to
      Washington as Senator. The blooming Rachel accompanies him; they live at a
      tavern in Pennsylvania Avenue called the &ldquo;Indian Queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This caravansary is kept by one O'Neal, who has a pretty daughter Peg.
      Later the pretty Peg will dissolve a Cabinet, make Mr. Van Buren
      President, and come within an ace of getting Mr. Calhoun hanged. All this,
      however, is in the unpierced future. The blooming, childless Rachel makes
      a pet of pretty Peg; which rivets the latter forever in the good regards
      of the General, who loves what the blooming Rachel loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Lewis proves a wizard of politics. Under his quiet legerdemain, here
      and there and everywhere political fires break forth in favor of the
      General. They break forth in North Carolina, in Pennsylvania, in New York;
      and, so deft and secret is his work, none suspects Wizard Lewis as the
      incendiary. Wizard Lewis is counseled by Colonel Burr who, like some old
      gray fox, sits in the mouth of his New York law-burrow in Nassau Street,
      peering out at events as they pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days, the lion-faced Webster writes his brother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His (the General's) manners are more presidential than those of any of
      the candidates. He is grave, mild, and reserved. My wife is for him
      decidedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are four candidates for the White House, <i>vide, licet</i>, the
      General, and Statesmen Adams and Crawford and Clay. The popular vote falls
      in the order given, with the General a long flight shot ahead of Statesman
      Adams, who is next on the list. And yet, while far in advance of the
      others, the General is without that electoral majority required by the
      Constitution, and the choice is thrown into the House of Representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Clay is now out of the running; for the President must be chosen
      from among the three candidates having the highest electoral vote, and he
      is fourth and lowest. Statesman Crawford, who ranks third, is also out. He
      is stricken of paralysis; and, while this wins him sympathy, it loses him
      White House strength. The fight is to be between the General and Statesman
      Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Statesman Clay is out of the coil, so far as any personal chance of
      becoming the House selection is concerned, he is in it decisively in
      another fashion. As a chief force in the House, he holds that important
      body in the hollow of his hand; and, while he cannot be its choice, he can
      control its choice. He controls it for Statesman Adams, on the underground
      understanding that he, Statesman Clay, shall sit at Statesman Adams' right
      hand as Secretary of State. Statesman Clay hopes to run presidentially
      another day, and thinks to make his calling and election sure while head
      of the Cabinet of Statesman Adams. As events forge and fuse themselves in
      the blast furnaces of the future, it will be discovered that in thus
      opining Statesman Clay falls into grievous error.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is four o'clock in the afternoon when the Clay-guided House counts
      Statesman Adams into a Presidency. Five hours afterward the General meets
      Statesman Adams in the East Room, where both are in attendance upon the
      last reception of outgoing President Munroe. The contrast between them
      tells in the General's favor. There is no gloom of disappointment on his
      brow, no cloud of defeat in his hawkish blue eyes. The General has a lady
      on his arm. He greets Statesman Adams gracefully and extends his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mr. Adams?&rdquo; cries he. &ldquo;I give you my left hand, sir, since my
      right is devoted to the fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Adams is a diplomat, and used to courts and salons. The General
      is of the wilderness and its battlefields. And yet the General shines out
      the more polished of the two. Statesman Adams takes the extended hand; but
      he does it awkwardly, backwardly, and with a wooden manner, as though his
      deportment is seized of some sudden, bashful stiffness of the joints. At
      last he manages to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir! I hope you are well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;THE KILLING EDGE OF SLANDER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>IZARD LEWIS boldly
      re-begins his work of White House capturing. He becomes busy to the elbows
      in the General's destinies before Statesman Adams is inaugurated. When the
      latter names Statesman Clay to be his Secretary of State, Wizard Lewis
      lays bare the deal which thus exalts the Kentuckian. He raises the cry of
      &ldquo;Bargain and Corruption!&rdquo; and the public takes it up. Statesman Adams and
      Statesman Clay are pilloried as conspirators who have wronged the General
      of a Presidency, and the State portfolio in the hands of Statesman Clay is
      pointed to as proof. The General writes the blooming Rachel, just now at
      home by the Cumberland:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Judas of the West has closed the contract and received the thirty
      pieces of silver.&rdquo; Statesman Clay defends himself badly. He declares that
      he objects to the General's White House ambitions only because he is a
      &ldquo;Military Chieftain.&rdquo; He speaks as though the world knows that a &ldquo;Military
      Chieftain&rdquo; will make a perilous Chief Magistrate. The world knows nothing
      of the sort; the cry of &ldquo;Bargain and Corruption&rdquo; gains head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In retort to that arraignment of being a &ldquo;Military Chieftain&rdquo;&mdash;made
      as if the phrase be merely another name for &ldquo;buccaneer&rdquo;&mdash;the General
      writes the old friendly fox, Colonel Burr:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not strange that he (Statesman Clay) should indulge himself in such
      reasoning, since it comes somewhat to his own personal defense. Our
      blue-grass Secretary has been ever remarkable for his caution, to give it
      a no worse name, and has not yet risked himself for his country, or moved
      from safe repose to repel an invading foe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General is not the only one who comments upon the astounding
      copartnership in politics and policies between Statesman Adams and
      Statesman Clay. John Randolph, of Roanoke, remarks concerning it, from his
      bitter place in the Senate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, it is a coming together of the puritan and the blackleg&mdash;Blifil
      and Black George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This view seems hugely to excite Statesman Clay, and he challenges the
      picturesque Randolph to a duel by Little Falls. They meet; but, since both
      are at pains to miss, no good comes of it.

      Wizard Lewis goes teaching the General's merits in every State of the
      Union. In his White House siege, Wizard Lewis receives his best help from
      Statesman Adams himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter publicist is a personage of ice-cold ideas, and lists
      ingratitude at the top of the virtues. There be folk&mdash;descended,
      doubtless, of ancestors that heated the pincers and turned the thumbikins,
      and worked the straining rack for the Inquisitions as mere day laborers at
      torture&mdash;who delight in doing mean, hateful, punishing things to
      their fellow mortals, if they may but call such doing &ldquo;duty.&rdquo; They will
      weep hypocritically while burning a victim, and aver, between sobs, that
      they pile the fagots and apply the torch only from a &ldquo;sternest conviction
      of duty.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; like the venom of a serpent, is ever in their
      mouths; by it they break hearts, destroy hopes, create blackness, blot out
      light, forbid happiness, foster grief, and plant pain in breasts innocent
      of every crime save that of helping them. Statesman Adams&mdash;heart as
      hollow as a bell and quite as brazen&mdash;is one of these. He
      demonstrates his purity by refusing his obligations, and proves himself
      great by turning his back on his friends. Made up of a multitude of
      littlenesses, he offers no trait of breadth or bigness as an offset. He is
      not wise; he is not brave; he is not generous; he is not&mdash;even in
      wrongdoing&mdash;original. He will guide by some maxim; or he will permit
      himself to be posed by a proverb; and, while ever breathlessly
      respectable, he is never once right. As President he proposes for himself
      an inhuman goodness, and declares that he will remove no one from office
      on &ldquo;account of politics&rdquo;&mdash;a catch phrase which has protected
      incompetency in place in every age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he is so fond of them, Statesman Adams, in taking the latter
      snow-white position, overlooks an aphorism that will be vital while time
      lasts. He forgets that &ldquo;The President who makes no removals will himself
      be removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike, lest you be stricken!&rdquo; murmured Queen Elizabeth, as seizing the
      pen she signed the warrant of block and axe for Scottish Mary, and it
      might be well and wise for Statesman Adams to wear in constant mind that
      illustrious example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought is vain. Statesman Adams ignores his friends, consults his
      foes, and offers a base picture of the ungrateful that draws the public's
      honest wrath his way. Wizard Lewis is no one to miss such opportunities to
      upbuild the General's fortunes at the expense of the enemy; and so the
      General grows each day stronger, while Statesman Adams&mdash;who hopes to
      succeed himself&mdash;owns less and less of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The currents of time flow swiftly now, and four years go by&mdash;four
      years wherein the old friendly far-seeing fox, Colonel Burr, in his Nassau
      Street burrow, teaches the General's leaders intrigue as a pedagogue
      teaches the alphabet to his pupils. And day after day the purblind Adams,
      with the purblind Clay at the elbow of his hopes and fears, sets traps
      against his own prospects, and does his unwitting best or worst to destroy
      himself. Then comes the canvass: the General against Statesman Adams, who
      courts a reelection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the rival forces march upon the field, the dullest marks the
      superiority of the General's. With that, Statesman Clay&mdash;in the war
      saddle for Statesman Adams, whose battle is his battle and whose defeat
      means his downfall&mdash;loses his head. He accuses the General of every
      offense except that of theft, calls him every name save that of coward.
      The accusations fail; the epithets fall harmless to the ground; the people
      know, and draw the closer about the General's standards. The latter's
      popularity rises as might a hurricane, and sweeps away opposition like
      down of thistles!
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Clay becomes frantic. Possessed as by a demon, he issues
      instructions to assail the blooming Rachel. His hound-pack obey the call.
      From that moment the General's marriage is the issue. He is charged with
      &ldquo;stealing another's wife,&rdquo; and every shaft of mendacious villification is
      shot against the unoffending bosom of the blooming Rachel. Those are
      fire-swept moments of anguish for the General, who feels the pain the
      more, since his hands are tied against what saw-handle methods silenced
      the dead Dickinson one May Kentucky morning in that poplar wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blooming Rachel, for her wronged part, says never a word. She goes the
      oftener to the little church, but that is all. And yet, while she seems so
      resigned and patient beneath the slandrous lash, the thong is biting
      always to her soul's source.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election takes place, and now the people speak. They set the grinding
      heel of their anger upon those slanders; they throw down that ladder of
      lies by which Statesman Adams hopes to climb. Wizard Lewis, Burr-guided,
      foils Statesman Clay at every point; the General rides down Statesman
      Adams like a coach and six.
    </p>
    <p>
      New England is tribal and narrow, with the reeking taint of old Federalism
      in its veins; it gives itself for Statesman Adams, unredeemed save by a
      single district in Maine. There, indeed, rises up one electoral vote for
      the General. It shows in the gray waste of Adams sentiment about it, like
      a green tree and a fountain against the gray wastes of Sahara. New Jersey,
      Delaware, Maryland follow in New England's dreary wake for Statesman
      Adams; while New York gives him sixteen electoral votes out of thirty-six.
      That offers the round circumference of his Clay-collected strength&mdash;an
      electoral vote of eighty-three!
    </p>
    <p>
      For the General, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
      Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, and Illinois go
      headlong; while New York gives him twenty electoral votes, with Tennessee
      his own by a popular count of twenty for one. Statesman Clay, as a retort
      to the slanders he fulminated, beholds his own State of Kentucky reject
      him, and aid in swelling those one hundred and seventy-eight electoral
      votes which declare for the General. The world at large, seated by its
      fireside and sagely thumbing those returns of one hundred and
      seventy-eight for the General against a meager eighty-three for Statesman
      Adams, finds therein a stunning rebuke to both the ambitions and the
      methods of Statesman Clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      When word of the General's election reaches the blooming Rachel, she
      smiles wearily and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the General's sake I'm glad! For myself I never wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that the war of the votes is over and the General victor, mankind
      relaxes into its customary dinners and parades. The Cumberland good people
      resolve to outparade all former parades, outdine all former dinners. They
      engage themselves with tremendous gala preparations. It shall be a time
      when oxen are eaten whole, and whisky is drunk by the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day set apart as sacred to the coming parade, and that dinner yet to
      be devoured, breaks brightly full of promise. There is never a cloud in
      the Cumberland sky, never a care on the Cumberland heart. In a moment all
      is reversed!&mdash;light gives way to blackness, happiness to grief! Like
      a bolt from a heaven smiling, the word descends that the blooming Rachel
      lies dead. The word is true. The monstrous weight of slander heaped upon
      it breaks her gentle heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      They bury the blooming Rachel at the foot of the garden where her
      best-loved flowers grow. The General is ten years older in a night; the
      tall form, yesterday as straight as a lance, is bent and broken. The blue
      eyes, once hawklike, are dimmed with tears. Friends come to press his hand&mdash;he
      chokes and cannot speak! But the awful agony of his soul is written in the
      sweat drops on his wrung brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the General stands by the grave that is smothering for him all the song
      and the sweet sunshine of life, the ever-faithful, never-failing Coffee is
      by his side. The poor General reaches blindly out and takes hold of the
      rough, big, loyal hand for support. His beloved Coffee, who flanked the
      Red Stick Creeks for him at the Horseshoe and held his low mud walls
      against England's boast and best at New Orleans, will not fail him now in
      this his sternest trial by the graveside of the blooming Rachel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, doubly quiet, doubly stern, issues forth of that ordeal
      another man. He is as one who lives because it is his duty, and not for
      love of life. Plainly, his hopes like his heart are buried with the
      blooming Rachel. In his soul he lays her death to the doors of Statesman
      Adams and Statesman Clay; throughout the years to follow he will never
      forget nor forgive. To the end he will cultivate his hatred of them, and
      tend it as he might a flower. Time cannot remold him in this belief; and a
      decade later he will say to his friend Lewis, while his eye flashes like
      some sudden-drawn rapier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major, she was stung to death by slander! It was such adders as John
      Quincy Adams, such pit-vipers as Henry Clay, that killed her!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX&mdash;THE GENERAL GOES TO THE WHITE HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS is of a
      steamboat day, and keel boats are but a memory. The General makes his
      tedious eight-weeks' way to Washington via the Cumberland, the Ohio, the
      mountains, and the Potomac valley. It is like the progress of a conqueror.
      The people throng about him until Wizard Lewis, remembering his broken
      state, fears for his life. The fears are without grounds to stand on.
      Applause never kills, and the General finds in it the milk of lions. He
      enters Washington renewed, and was never so fit for hard work. The General
      is inaugurated. As he is cheered into the White House by jubilant
      thousands, Statesman Clay, beaten and bitter, retires to Kentucky; while
      Statesman Adams goes back to Massachusetts, where his ice-waterisms, let
      us hope, will be appreciated, and from which frigid region he ought never
      to have been drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the General is declared President, Statesman Calhoun is made
      Vice-President. From his high perch in the Senate Statesman Calhoun begins
      at once to scan the plain of the possible for ways and means to name
      himself the General's successor. He proves dull in the furtherance of his
      ambitions, and conceives that the only best path to victory lies over the
      General himself. He must break down that demigod in the hearts of the
      people, and teach them to hate where now they trust and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General is not a day in Washington before Statesman Calhoun is
      intriguing to cut the ground of popularity from beneath his feet. As
      frequently happens with dark-lantern strategists, his plottings in their
      very inception go off on the wrong foot. Statesman Calhoun is so foolish
      as to commence his campaign against the General with an attack upon a
      woman. The woman thus malevolently distinguished is the pretty Peg, once
      belle of the Indian Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between that time when the General came last to Washington as Senator and
      the pretty Peg was petted and loved by the blooming Rachel, and now when
      the General occupies the White House as President, destiny has been moving
      rapidly and not always gayly with the pretty Peg. In that interim she
      becomes the wife of Purser Timberlake of the Navy, who later cuts his
      drunken throat and walks overboard to his drunken death in the
      Mediterranean.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her widow's weeds the pretty Peg looks prettier than before&mdash;since
      black is ever the best setting for beauty, and shows it off like a
      diamond. Major Eaton, Senator from Tennessee and per incident friend of
      the General, is smitten of the pretty Peg, and marries her. The wedding
      bells are ringing as the General rides into Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an hour wherein Vice-Presidents have more to say than they will
      later on. Statesman Calhoun, scheming his own advantage, puts forward
      covert efforts to place his friends about the General as cabineteers. This
      is not so difficult; since the General is not thinking on Statesman
      Calhoun. His eyes, hate-guided, are fastened upon Statesman Adams and
      Statesman Clay; his single aim is to advance no follower of theirs. These
      are happy conditions for Statesman Calhoun, who comes up unseen on the
      General's blind side, and presents him&mdash;all unnoticed&mdash;with
      three of his Cabinet six.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun, who prefers four to three, next tries all he secretly
      knows to control the General's choice of a War Secretary. In this he meets
      defeat; the General selects Major Eaton, just wedded to the pretty Peg.
      His completed Cabinet includes Van Buren, Secretary of State; Ingham,
      Secretary of the Treasury; Eaton, Secretary of War; Branch, Secretary of
      the Navy; Berrien, Attorney General; and Barry, Postmaster General. Of
      these, Statesman Calhoun, craftily reviewing the list from his perch in
      the Senate, may call Cabi-neteers Ingham, Branch, and Berrien his
      henchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General is not aware of this Calhoun color to his Cabinet. The last
      man of the six hates Statesman Clay and Statesman Adams; which is the
      consideration most upon the General's mind. He does not like Statesman
      Calhoun. But he in no sort suspects him; and, at this crisis of Cabinet
      making, that plotting Vice-President is not at all upon the General's
      slope of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content with half the Cabinet, Statesman Calhoun resents privily his
      failure to control the war portfolio. He resolves to attack Major Eaton,
      and drive him from the place. As much wanting in chivalry as in a wisdom
      of the popular, he decides to assail him through the pretty Peg. It is the
      error of Statesman Calhoun's career, which now becomes one blundering
      procession of mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun's attack on the pretty Peg begins with hidden
      adroitness. There lives in Philadelphia a smug dominie named Ely. On the
      merest Calhoun hint in the dark, Dominie Ely&mdash;who has a mustard-seed
      soul&mdash;writes the General a letter, wherein he charges the pretty Peg
      with every immorality. Dominie Ely prayerfully protests against the
      husband of a woman so morally ebon making one of the General's official
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General is in flames in a moment. His loved and blooming Rachel was
      stabbed to death by slander! The pretty Peg was the blooming Rachel's
      favorite, in that old day at the Indian Queen! The General possesses every
      angry reason for being aroused, and he sends fiercely for smug Dominie
      Ely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The villifying Dominie Ely appears before the General in fear and
      trembling&mdash;color stricken from his fat cheek. He falteringly
      confesses that he has been inspired to his slanders by a Dominie Campbell.
      The furious General summons Dominie Campbell, about whom there is a
      Calhoun atmosphere of jackal and buzzard in even parts. The General hurls
      pointed questions at Dominie Campbell, and catches him in lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the General is putting to flight the two black-coat buzzards of
      slander, the war breaks out in a new quarter. The &ldquo;Ladies of Washington,&rdquo;
       compared to whom the Red Stick Creeks at the Horseshoe and the redcoat
      English at New Orleans are as children's toys, fall upon the General's
      social flank. They hate the pretty Peg because she is more beautiful than
      they. They resent her as the daughter of a tavern keeper&mdash;a common
      tapster!&mdash;who is now being lifted to a social eminence equal with
      their own. These reasons bring the &ldquo;Ladies of Washington&rdquo; to the field.
      But with militant sapiency they conceal them, and adopt as the pretended
      cause of their onslaught the slanders of those ophidians, Dominie Ely and
      Dominie Campbell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Calhoun, wife of Statesman Calhoun, at the head of Capital fashion
      and social war-chief of the &ldquo;Ladies of Washington,&rdquo; says she will not
      &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; the pretty Peg. Mrs. Ingham, Mrs. Branch, and Mrs. Berrien,
      wives of the three Cabineteers who wear in private the colors of Statesman
      Calhoun, say they will not &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; the pretty Peg. Mrs. Donelson, wife
      of the General's private secretary and <i>ex officio</i> &ldquo;Lady of the
      White House,&rdquo; says she will not &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; the pretty Peg. The latter
      drawing-room Red Stick is the General's niece. Also, she is in fashionable
      leading strings to Mrs. Calhoun, who as social war-chief of the &ldquo;Ladies of
      Washington&rdquo; dazzles and benumbs her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Donelson approaches the General concerning the pretty Peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything but that, Uncle!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I am sorry to offend you, but I
      cannot 'recognize' Mrs. Eaton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'd better go back to Tennessee, my dear!&rdquo; returns the General,
      between puffs at his clay pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Donelson and her unwilling spouse go back to Tennessee. The war
      against the pretty Peg goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's Cabinet is a house divided against itself. Cabineteers
      Ingham, Branch, and Berrien align themselves with Statesman Calhoun on
      this issue of the pretty Peg. For each has a ring in his nose, a wedding
      ring, and his wife leads him about by it socially, hither and yon as she
      chooses. Cabineteers Van Buren and Barry range themselves with Cabineteer
      Eaton and the pretty Peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabineteer Van Buren is short, round, fat, smooth, adroit, ambitious, and
      so much the mental tree-toad that, now when he is in contact with the
      positive General, his every opinion takes its color from that warrior.
      Also Cabineteer Van Buren is a widower, with no wife to lead him socially
      by the nose. Hat in hand, he calls upon the pretty Peg&mdash;a politeness
      which pleases the General tremendously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabineteer Van Buren gives dinners, and asks the pretty Peg to perform as
      hostess. With a wise eye on the General, he incites Cabineteer Barry, who
      is a bachelor, to burst into similar dinners, with the pretty Peg in
      command. By his suggestion, Minister Vaughn of the English and Minister
      Krudener of the Russians, who like Cabineteer Barry are bachelors, follow
      amiable suit. They give legation dinners, at which the pretty Peg
      presides. The General adopts these brilliant examples with the White
      House. The pretty Peg finds herself in control of such society high ground
      as the English and Russian legations, two Cabinet houses besides her own,
      and last and most important the White House itself. It is a merry even if
      a savage war, and the pretty Peg is everywhere victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not everywhere! Mrs. Calhoun, as war-chief of the &ldquo;Ladies of Washington,&rdquo;
       with Mrs. Ingham, Mrs. Branch, and Mrs. Berrien about her as a staff,
      refuses to yield. These four indomitables and their beflounced and
      be-feathered followers, noses uptilted in scorn of the pretty Peg,
      prosecute their battle to the acrid end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earlier stages, the General, his angry thoughts on Statesman Clay,
      inclines to the belief that these attacks on the pretty Peg are of that
      defeated personage's connivance, and says so to Wizard Lewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wizard Lewis, when the General is inaugurated, is for returning to his
      Cumberland home, but finds himself restrained by the lonesome General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cries the latter, &ldquo;would you leave me now, after doing more than
      all the rest to land me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon which reproach, Wizard Lewis remains, and lives in the White House
      with the General. It befalls that with the earliest slanders of the
      ophidians, Dominie Ely and Dominie Campbell, the General goes to Wizard
      Lewis with accusations against Statesman Clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that pit-viper, Henry Clay!&rdquo; cries the General. &ldquo;Major, the pet
      employment of that scoundrel is the vindication of good women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wizard Lewis holds to a different view. He declares that the secret
      impulse of this base war is Statesman Calhoun, and proves it as events
      unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; asks the General, &ldquo;why should he assail little Peg? Both he and
      Mrs. Calhoun called upon her and Major Eaton, and congratulated them on
      their marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was while Major Eaton was a senator,&rdquo; Wizard Lewis responds, &ldquo;and
      before he became War Secretary and got in the way of the Calhoun plans.
      Your Vice-President, General, is mad to be President. Also, he is so
      blurred in his strategy as to imagine that these attacks on little Peg
      will advance his prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General snorts suspiciously; a light breaks upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your theory is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that Calhoun assails Peg as a step toward
      the presidency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, General! Rightly construed, it is not an attack on Peg, but
      you. He is trying to put you before the people in the role of one who
      countenances the immoral, and upholds a bad woman. In that he hopes to
      array every virtuous fireside against you. He looks for you to ask a
      second term; and, by any means in his power, he will strive to destroy you
      out of his path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, was there ever such infamy!&rdquo; cries the General. &ldquo;Here is a man so
      vile that he would pave his way to the White House with the slain honor of
      a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hate of the General is now focused upon Statesman Calhoun. That
      ignoble strategist, he resolves, shall never achieve the presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one wherewith to defeat Statesman Calhoun and succeed himself, the
      General picks upon Cabineteer Van Buren&mdash;that suave one, who is so
      much to the urbane fore for the pretty Peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; says the General to Wizard Lewis; &ldquo;I'll take a second term!
      And then, Major, we will make Matt President after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll do more,&rdquo; returns Wizard Lewis. &ldquo;When we elect you President the
      second time, we'll shove aside the plotting Calhoun, and make Van Buren
      Vice-President.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; exults the General. &ldquo;Then, should I die, Matt will at once step
      into my shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither the General nor Wizard Lewis is at pains to conceal their design.
      The sallow cheek of Statesman Calhoun grows sallower; for the news is like
      an icicle through his heart. It in no wise abates his war upon the pretty
      Peg, however; which&mdash;as Wizard Lewis guesses&mdash;is only meant to
      break down the General with good people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vindicated; in all quarters she rises in triumph over Mrs. Calhoun, Mrs.
      Ingham, Mrs. Branch, Mrs. Berrien, and what other &ldquo;society Red Sticks&rdquo;&mdash;as
      he terms them&mdash;seek her destruction. The next thing is to shear away
      the cabinet strength of Statesman Calhoun. Wizard Lewis recommends a
      dissolution of the Cabinet. He lays his thought before the General, who
      sits listening in the smoke of his long pipe. Cabineteer Van Buren will
      resign. Cabi-neteers Eaton and Barry will emulate his example and turn
      over their portfolios. With half his Cabinet gone, should the Calhoun
      three prove backward, the General shall demand their portfolios.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asks the General, his iron-gray head in a cloud of tobacco
      smoke.

      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;WIZARD LEWIS URGES A CHANGE IN FRONT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>IZARD LEWIS,
      bending his brows to the situation, now counsels an extreme step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will make Van Buren Minister to England, and give Major Eaton
      the governorship of Florida. Little Peg should look well in the palace at
      St. Augustine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Eternal!&rdquo; cries the General, as he hurls his clay pipe into the
      fireplace where hundreds of its brittle predecessors have gone crashing&mdash;&ldquo;by
      the Eternal, we'll do it! The last vestige of a Calhoun cabinet influence
      shall be wiped out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It comes to pass as Wizard Lewis programmes. Cabineteer Van Buren resigns,
      and Cabineteers Eaton and Barry hasten to follow his lead. The three other
      cabineteers sit dazed; the suddenness of the thing takes away their
      cabinet breaths. They sit dazed so long that the General loses patience
      and asks for their portfolios. One by one they hand them in, as it were at
      the White House door&mdash;Cabineteer Ingham being last and most reluctant
      of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      There be tears and mournful wailings now among the society Red Sticks.
      Mrs. Ingham, Mrs. Branch, and Mrs. Berrien are shaken in their social
      souls, never for one moment having foreseen this movement in disastrous
      flank. However, there is no help for it. The deposed three wash off their
      social war paint, and go their divers ways lamenting; while the General
      and Wizard Lewis grin sourly over their fireside pipes. As for Statesman
      Calhoun, his schemes experience a chill; for in thus sending Cabineteers
      Ingham, Branch, and Berrien into political exile, the General drives a
      knife to the very heart of his selfish diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabinet wiped out, the General constructs another, with his old-time
      friend and comrade Livingston as Secretary of State. Also, the agreeable
      Van Buren departs for the Court of St. James as the General's envoy to
      England, while Major Eaton and the villified yet victorious Peg wend
      southward among the flowers to rule over Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he leaves Washington, the ill-used Eaton makes praiseworthy
      attempts to fasten a duel upon ex-Cabineteer Ingham, who hires a whole
      stage coach and gallops off to Baltimore&mdash;the fear of death upon him&mdash;to
      avoid being sacrificed. The flight of ex-Cabineteer Ingham is a shock to
      the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he was a bad, designing man,&rdquo; says the General with a sigh; &ldquo;but,
      upon my soul, Major, I didn't think him a coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun, weaker by virtue of that Cabinet lopping off, is still
      too narrowly set in his White House ambitions to give up the war. In this
      he is much sustained by the Senate, which jealous body pretends to possess
      its own causes of complaint. Chief among these is the obvious manner in
      which the General promotes the importance of that old fox, Colonel Burr.
      The General shows that he cares more for the appointment-indorsement of
      Colonel Burr than for the recommendations of half the Senate. This does
      not set well on the proud senatorial stomachs of the togaed ones; and,
      with Statesman Calhoun to lead them, they are willing to obstruct and
      baffle the General in his policies. Moved of this spirit, and at the
      instigation of Statesman Calhoun, the Senate refuses to confirm the
      appointment of Minister Van Buren&mdash;a Burrite&mdash;who thereupon
      makes his farewell unruffled bow to the great ones at St. James and
      returns amiably home.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Thomas Benton, who was so fortunate as to fall into a receptive
      cellar on a certain Nashville occasion when the muzzle of the General's
      saw-handle was at his breast, and who is now in the Senate from Missouri,
      gives Statesman Calhoun notice of what he may expect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have broken a minister,&rdquo; observes the farsighted Benton&mdash;&ldquo;you
      have broken a Minister to make a Vice-President.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the slander battle against the pretty Peg is raging, a storm cloud
      of a different character is gathering over the General. Although Statesman
      Clay has no part in that war upon the pretty Peg, he by no means sits with
      folded hands in idleness.

    </h5>
    <p>
      There is a certain money-creature called the United States Bank. It is
      controlled by one Biddle of Philadelphia. Banker Biddle is a glistening,
      serpentine personage, oily and avaricious&mdash;a polished composite of
      assurance, greed, and lies. He is a proven and unscrupulous corruptionist,
      and a majority of both Senate and House wait upon his money-bidding. Under
      the Biddle influence, the Bank never fails to consider the mere &ldquo;name&rdquo; of
      a Congressman as perfect collateral for a loan. Even so incorrigible a
      bankrupt as the lion-faced Webster is good at the Biddle Bank for
      thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure in its hold on Congress, and insolent&mdash;as Money ever is when
      it feels secure&mdash;the Biddle Bank thinks to crack a political whip.
      The main bank is in Philadelphia. There are twenty-five branch banks
      scattered here and there throughout the country. In pursuance of its
      determination to dominate politics, the Biddle Bank suddenly refuses loans
      to the General's friends. Banker Biddle and the Bank are secretly moved to
      these doughty attitudes by Statesman Clay, who, with his party of the
      Whigs, has for long been their ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Clay, in possession of the machinery of his party, is resolved
      to put his own name forward at the head of the next Whig ticket against
      the formidable General. He foresees that Statesman Calhoun&mdash;who is of
      the General's party of the Democrats&mdash;will come to utter grief in his
      intrigues to supplant the General and make himself a candidate. And yet,
      the blue-grass Machiavelli can use Statesman Calhoun. The latter is
      powerful with the Senate. The Senate hates the General as blindly as does
      Statesman Calhoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machiavelli Clay resolves to have advantage of this double condition of
      hatred. He will beguile the General to attack the Biddle Bank. The attack
      can only be made by message to Congress. That should be the opportunity of
      Machiavelli Clay. He will have the Senate for the battle ground; and it
      shall go hard if he do not emerge with the General defeated and the Bank
      and Banker Biddle at his back. With such friends in the campaign to come
      later he should have the General and his party of democracy at his mercy.
      Thus dreams Machiavelli Clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a beautiful dream&mdash;this long-drawn chicane of Machiavelli Clay.
      As a move toward its realization he suggests the policy of a loan
      hostility toward the General's friends; for the General will fight almost
      as quickly for a friend as for a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banker Biddle adopts it, and the Bank develops it in Portsmouth. The paper
      of one of the General's friends&mdash;a Mr. Isaac Hill&mdash;is
      dishonored, and the General's friendship is understood to be the reason.
      The thing is managed like a challenge, and has the instant effect of
      bringing the General&mdash;ever ready for such a war&mdash;to the field.
      In its invidious attitude toward his friends, the Bank throws down the
      glove; and the General promptly picks it up. In a message to Congress, he
      assails the Bank; and the fight is on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money is always a coward, and commonly a fool. Also its instinct is the
      weak instinct of corruption. Its attitude toward a public is ever that of
      the threatening, bullying, bragging terrorist, who will either rule or
      ruin. It works by fear, and resorts to every quack device. It will gnash
      its jaws, lash its tail, spout fire and smoke in the face of a quailing
      world. And yet all this tail-lashing and jaw-gnashing and fire-spouting is
      a sham. Money, for all its appearance of ferocity, is no more perilous to
      folk who face it than is the fire-spouting, jaw-gnashing, tail-lashing
      papier-maché dragon of grand opera. Attack it, and what follows? A couple
      of rueful supernumeraries crawl abjectly, if grumblingly, from its
      papier-maché stomach&mdash;the complete yet harmless reason of the
      jaw-gnashing, fire-spouting, tail-lashing from which a frightened world
      shrunk back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these furious matters, Money does another lying thing. It seeks to
      teach the public to regard it as the palpitant heart of the country
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the seat of life!&rdquo; cries Money. &ldquo;Touch me, and you die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The advantage of this lie is clear; that is, if the lie win credit. Being
      the heart, however corrupt, no law surgery may reach it. If Money were the
      hand of a people, or the fingers on that hand, then it might be dealt
      with. It could be statute-lanced or poulticed or even amputated, and no
      threat to life ensue. Money foresees this; and, with that lying cunning
      which is ever the scoundrel sword and shield of cowards, it declares
      itself to be the heart. Thus is it safeguarded against the honest least
      correction of communal saw and knife. Being the heart, its vileness may be
      deplored but cannot be mended. For who is the mediciner that shall handle
      the heart to any result save death?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet while Money thus proclaims itself the nation's heart it lies. It
      is not even so reputable a member as the hand. At the most it comes to be
      no more than just a thumb, or a forefinger, and the farthest possible
      remove from any source of life. Folk who would aid their money-throttled
      hour must remember these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banker Biddle and the Bank, now when the General advances upon them, go
      through that furious charlatanry of jaw-gnashing, tail-lashing, and
      fire-spouting. The General is unconvinced, unterrified. His hawk eyes
      pierce the miserable masquerade. He knows the Bank for a dragon of paper
      and pretense, and does not hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failing to arouse his personal-political fear, Banker Biddle and the Bank
      attempt to stay the General by proclaiming a peril to the country at
      large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are the throbbing heart of all prosperity!&rdquo; they cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General recognizes the lie. He knows that prosperity comes from the
      rain and the sun and the soil, and not from banks or bankers. As well
      might the two-bushel sacks declare themselves to be the harvest reason of
      a nation's wheat. The General continues his advance. There shall be no
      evasion, no hiding, no safety by lies; masks are not to avail nor
      pretenses protect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General in his attack on Banker Biddle and the Bank displays a genius
      even with that which he employed against the English at New Orleans.
      Banker Biddle and the Bank are the petted custodians of all the millions
      of Government. The General &ldquo;removes&rdquo; those millions&mdash;a yellow
      mountain of gold! Incidentally, he dismisses a weak-kneed Secretary of the
      Treasury as a preliminary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remove the deposits!&rdquo; says the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not!&rdquo; whines the weak-kneed one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take the responsibility!&rdquo; urges the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the weak-kneed one falters. At that the General sets him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;removal&rdquo; of those Government millions, which is as the drawing off of
      half their life blood, leaves the Bank and Banker Biddle exceeding pale in
      the face. They look appealingly at Statesman Clay, who, the better to
      manage his side of the conflict, has taken a Kentucky seat in the Senate.
      Statesman Clay encourages the Bank and Banker Biddle. It will all come
      right, he says; there is a Senate bomb preparing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring the General squarely before the public as the Bank's destroyer,
      Statesman Clay anticipates the years and offers a measure renewing the
      charter of that money temple. Statesman Calhoun, with every Senate foe of
      the General, is for it. The measure gallops through both Senate and House.
      It is sent whirling to the White House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he sign it?&rdquo; wonders Statesman Clay, in consultation with his own
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an anxious moment Statesman Clay fears the coming of that signature;
      he cannot conceive of courage greater than his own. His anxiety is
      misplaced. The General will not sign. When the Clay-constructed measure
      renewing the charter of the Bank is laid before him, with about what ado
      might attend the killing of a garter snake he breaks its back with his
      veto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Clay rubs his satisfied hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says he to Banker Biddle, who is becoming a bit weak, &ldquo;we have him
      helpless! That veto is his death warrant! The campaign is at hand; I shall
      be the candidate of my party, he of his. That veto shall be the issue!
      Money, you know, is all powerful. Being so, who shall doubt the result
      when now the public is driven to choose between the Bank and the White
      House&mdash;Prosperity and Andrew Jackson?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE DOWNFALL OF MACHIAVELLI CLAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ACHIAVELLI CLAY is
      one who looks seldom from the window and often in the glass. No man
      carries himself more upon the back of his own regard than does Machiavelli
      Clay. He believes in the wisdom of the classes, the ignorance of the
      masses, and thinks that government should be of people, by statesmen, for
      statesmen. Also he has a profound respect for Money, and little for
      perishing flesh and blood. As to each of these thought-conditions he lives
      in head-on collision with the General, who in all things is his precise
      contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a guide by which the popular view may direct itself, Machiavelli Clay
      asks the Senate to pass a vote of censure upon the General. With the help
      of Statesman Calhoun, he puts it through. The Clay-invoked &ldquo;censure&rdquo;
       strikes these sparks from the General:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; he cries, thinking on his saw-handles as he and Wizard Lewis sit
      with their evening pipes, &ldquo;if I live to get these robes of office off, I
      may yet bring that rascal to a dear account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Banker Biddle, now when his precious Bank for its life or death will be
      made the campaign issue, is not without those pale misgivings which ever
      shake the livid heart of Money on the eve of war. Observing this
      knee-knocking trepidation, Machiavelli Clay attempts to give him courage.
      This is no difficult task for Machiavelli Clay to undertake; since, in his
      native ignorance of the popular, he harbors no doubt of the General's
      downfall. Also he extends cheering word the more readily to the quaking
      Banker Biddle, because the latter and his jeopardized Bank are to furnish
      those golden sinews of war, which will be required for the Whig campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machiavelli Clay uplifts the confidence of Banker Biddle to a point where
      the latter, from his money lair in Philadelphia, writes him the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He (the General) has all the fury of a chained panther biting the bars
      of its cage&mdash;a condition which I think should contribute to relieve
      the country of the tyranny of this miserable man. You, my dear sir, are
      destined to be the instrument of that deliverance, and at no period of
      your life has the public had a deeper stake in you.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In so writing to Machiavelli Clay, Banker Biddle permits his hopes to
      overrun his intelligence. Machiavelli Clay is not to become &ldquo;the
      deliverer&rdquo; of his hour, nor shall the &ldquo;chained panther&rdquo; in the White House
      be cast out. Machiavelli Clay, however, is no Elijah gifted of prophecy;
      but, on the wooden-witted other hand, proves quite as besotted touching
      the future as does Banker Biddle. He replies to that financier in these
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fear not; there shall come a cleansing of the Augean stables! Our
      cause cannot fail! That veto of the Bank charter is a broad confession of
      the incompetency of the Administration, and shows him (the General) unfit
      to carry on the business of government. I think we are authorized to
      confidently anticipate his defeat</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now when the candidates of the Democratic party are about to be named,
      Statesman Calhoun foresees that he himself will be ignored, and
      ex-Cabineteer Van Buren supplant him, nominationally, for the place of
      Vice-President.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save his chagrin, and on the principle that when one is about to be
      thrown out it is wise to go out, he resigns from his vice-presidential
      perch, lays down the Senate gavel, and returns to his home-state of South
      Carolina. Once there, following the Kentucky example of Machiavelli Clay,
      he sees to it that his own Legislature returns him to Washington as a
      Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun abandons hope of making his appearance as a White House
      candidate in the campaign at hand. What then? He is of middle years, and
      can wait. He will lie back and watch the struggle between the General and
      Machiavelli Clay. Let victory fall where it may, he, Statesman Calhoun,
      will prepare himself for his own sure triumph in the conflict four years
      away. Which demonstrates that, while his judgment is crippled, his
      ambition stands as tall and as straight as a mountain pine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tickets are brought to the field&mdash;the General against Machiavelli
      Clay, with ex-Cabineteer Van Buren, and a Whig obscurity named Sargent
      running for second place. The issue presents the alternative&mdash;the
      General or the Bank, humanity in a death-hug with Money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machiavelli Clay and Banker Biddle have no fears; for they are gold-blind
      and can see nothing beyond themselves. They are given a rude awakening.
      The people speak; and when the sound of that speaking dies out, the
      General has overwhelmed Machiavelli Clay with two hundred and nineteen
      electoral votes against the latter's sixty-nine. Machiavelli Clay and
      Banker Biddle and the Bank go down, while the General&mdash;ever the
      conqueror and never once the conquered&mdash;sweeps back to the
      presidency. Also ex-Cabineteer Van Buren is made Vice-President, as
      aforetime resolved upon by the General and Wizard Lewis, and from that
      Senate eminence, so lately vacated by Statesman Calhoun, will wield the
      gavel over togaed discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, President the second time, picks up the reins, settles
      himself upon the box, and proceeds to drive his governmental times after
      this wise. He kills out what few sparks of life still animate the Biddle
      Bank. He removes the Creeks and Cherokees from Florida and Georgia, and
      thereby guarantees the scalp on many an innocent head. He throws open the
      public lands for settlement at nominal figures. He fosters a gold currency
      and discourages paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pays off the last splinter of the national debt, and offers to the
      wondering eyes of history the spectacle of a country that doesn't owe a
      dollar. He makes commercial treaties with every tribe of Europe. Finally,
      he compels France to pay five millions in gold for outrages long ago
      committed upon the sailors of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last is not brought about without some show of force. France, at the
      General's demand, falls into a white heat of rage and froths for instant
      war. The General takes France at her warlike word, notifies Congress, and
      orders his fleet into the Mediterranean, the flagship <i>Constitution</i>
      in the van.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool vigor of the move sets France gasping. She consults England
      across the Channel, and is privily assured that whipping a Yankee
      eighty-gun ship is a feat so difficult of marine accomplishment that, like
      the blossoming of the century plant, it would be foolish to look for it
      oftener than once in one hundred years. It is England's impression,
      whispered in the Frankish ear, that it will be cheaper to pay the five
      millions. Whereupon, France breaks into diplomatic smiles, assures the
      General that her late war-rage was mere humor and her froth a jest. And
      pays.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of a little junket, the General visits New England, and at the
      genial sight of him that chill region thaws like icicles in July. Indeed,
      the New England temperature rises to a height where Harvard College
      confers upon the General the degree of Doctor of Laws. At which Statesman
      Adams nurses his wrath with this entry in his sour diary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seminaries of learning have been timeservers and sycophants in every
      age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General has done his people many a service. He has defended them from
      savage Red Stick Creeks, and savage Red-coat English with their war cry of
      &ldquo;Beauty and Booty!&rdquo; Now he will do his foremost work of all, and buckler
      them against the javelins of treason, save them from between the jaws of a
      conspiracy&mdash;wolfish and widespread for national destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conspiracy has its birth in the ambition-crazed bosom of Statesman
      Calhoun; its shiboleth is &ldquo;Nullification!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would sooner,&rdquo; said Caesar, when his courtiers were laughing at the
      pompous mayor of a little mud town in Spain&mdash;&ldquo;I would sooner be first
      here than second in Rome!&rdquo; And, centuries after, the sentiment wakes a
      responsive echo in the jealous breast of Statesman Calhoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun aims to follow the General in the headship of American
      affairs. Defeated of that, he is resolved to sever those constitutional
      links which bind his home-state of South Carolina to her sister States in
      Federal Union, and declare her a nation by and of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his new rôle of &ldquo;seceder,&rdquo; Statesman Calhoun makes this impression on
      the English Harriet Martineau. After speaking of him as involving himself
      tighter and tighter in spinnings of political mysticism and fantastic
      speculation, she calls him a &ldquo;cast-iron man&rdquo; and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He (Calhoun) is eager, absorbed, overspeculative. I know of no one who
      lives in such intellectual solitude. He meets men and harangues them by
      the fireside as in the Senate. He is wrought like a piece of machinery,
      set going vehemently by a weight, and stops while you answer. He either
      passes by what you say, or twists it into suitability with what is in his
      head, and begins to lecture again. He is full of his 'Nullification,' and
      those who know the force that is in him and his utter incapacity for
      modification by other minds, will no more expect repose and self-retention
      from him than from a volcano in full force. Relaxation is no longer in the
      power of his will. I never saw anyone who gave me so completely the idea
      of 'possession.</i>'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By which the English woman would say that she thinks Statesman Calhoun
      insane. She overstates, however, his &ldquo;incapacity for modification&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;self-retention.&rdquo; There will come a day when he does not pause, nor close
      his eyes in sleep, between Washington and his home in South Carolina, such
      is his fear-spurred eagerness&mdash;with the shadow of the gibbet all
      across him!&mdash;to stamp out what fires of treason he has been at pains
      to kindle, and avoid that halter which the General promises as their
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in Senate debate that Statesman Calhoun removes the mask from his
      intended treason, and gives the world a glimpse of its blackness. He
      threatens, unless the tariff be changed to match his pleasure, that South
      Carolina will prevent its enforcement within her borders. He declares
      South Carolina superior to the nation in her powers, and proclaims for her
      the right to &ldquo;nullify&rdquo; what Federal laws she deems inimical to her
      peculiar interest. He shows how South Carolina will, as against the tariff
      contemplated, invoke that inherent right to &ldquo;nullify,&rdquo; and says, should
      the Washington government attempt to coerce her, she will take herself out
      of the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this exposition of States rights, the General in the White House
      listens with gathering scorn. He turns to Wizard Lewis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; he cries, addressing that Merlin of politics, &ldquo;if one is to
      believe Calhoun, the Union is like a bag of meal open at both ends. No
      matter how you pick it up, the meal all runs out. I shall tie the bag and
      save the country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Treason, however base, will have its friends, and Statesman Calhoun goes
      not without &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; followers. In his own mischievous State the
      doctrine is received with open arms. The Governor issues his proclamation;
      a convention of the people is authorized by the Legislature. They are to
      meet at Columbia and settle the details of &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; in its
      practical workings out. They do meet; and adopt unanimously an &ldquo;Ordinance
      of Nullification&rdquo; which declares the tariff just made in Washington &ldquo;Null,
      void, and no law, nor binding upon this State, its officers or citizens.&rdquo;
       They decree that no duties, enjoined by such tariff, shall be paid or
      permitted to be paid in any port of South Carolina. The closing assertion
      of the &ldquo;Ordinance&rdquo; runs that, should the Government of the United States
      try by force to collect the tariff duties, &ldquo;The people of South Carolina
      will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further obligation to
      maintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the
      other States, and will proceed to organize a separate government, and do
      all other acts and things which sovereign and independent States may of
      right do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0321.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Following this doughty setting-out of what one might call the
      Palmetto-rattlesnake position, the Governor suggests military associations
      on the model of the Minute Men of the Revolution, and makes ready for what
      blood-letting shall be required to sustain Statesman Calhoun in his new
      preachment. Altogether it is a South Carolina day of bombast and blue
      cockades, with Statesman Calhoun already chosen as the president of a
      coming &ldquo;Southern Confederacy.&rdquo; While these dour matters are in process of
      Palmetto transaction, Statesman Hayne encounters the lion-faced Webster on
      the floor of the Senate, and the latter establishes forever the rightful
      supremacy of the Federal Union, and demonstrates that the &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo;
       set up by Statesman Calhoun is but the chimera of a jaundiced,
      ambition-bitten mind. Thus canters the hour in the Senate and in South
      Carolina; while up in the White House the General sits reading a book.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE FEDERAL UNION: IT MUST BE PRESERVED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE General is
      reading his book, when in walks Wizard Lewis. The latter necromancer
      casually alludes to Statesman Calhoun, and his pet infamy of
      &ldquo;Nullification.&rdquo; At this the General's honest rage begins to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bear witness, Major,&rdquo; he cries&mdash;&ldquo;you bear witness how Calhoun is
      trying me! But by the living heavens, I'll uphold the law!&rdquo; Then, shaking
      the ponderous tome at Wizard Lewis, his finger marking the place&mdash;&ldquo;Here!
      I've been reading what old John Marshall said in the case of Aaron Burr.
      He makes treason in its definition as plain as a pikestaff. A man can't <i>think</i>
      treason; he can't <i>talk</i> treason; he can only <i>act</i> treason. It
      requires an act&mdash;an overt act! Calhoun is safe while he only talks or
      conspires. But let one of his followers perform one act of opposition to
      the law, even if it be no more than hand on sword hilt or just the
      snapping of a fireless flint against an empty rifle-pan, and I have him.
      There would be the overt act demanded by old Marshall; and he goes on to
      say that the overt act, once committed, attaches to all of the
      conspirators and becomes the act of each. I shall keep my ear as well as
      my eye, Major, on Calhoun's State of South Carolina; and, at the first
      crackling of a treasonable twig beneath a traitorous foot, into a felon's
      cell goes he. Then we shall see what a hempen noose will do for him and
      his 'Nullification.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General, the better to deliver this long oration, gets up and walks
      the floor. Having concluded, down he drops into his chair again, and to
      grubbing at old John Marshall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General and Wizard Lewis decide that a perfect White House silence
      concerning &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; is the proper course. The General will sit
      mute, and never by so much as the arching of a bushy brow intimate what he
      will do, should Statesman Calhoun push his treason to that last extreme&mdash;that
      overt act of opposition to the Federal law and its enforcement, demanded
      by the great Chief Justice. And so, while arises all this turmoil of
      treason in the Senate and South Carolina, the White House is as voiceless
      as a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the General is silent, he is in no sort idle. He makes secret
      preparations to bruise the head of the serpent of secession with a heel of
      steel. He sends General Scott to South Carolina. Into Castle Pinckney he
      conveys thousands of rifles. One by one his warships drop into Charleston
      harbor, until, with broadsides trained upon the town, scores of them ride
      at ominous anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General gets word to his ever-reliable Coffee. In those well-nigh
      twenty years which have come and gone since the English were swept up in
      fire at New Orleans, the hunting-shirt men in the General's country of
      Tennessee have increased and multiplied. Their numbers are such that at
      the end of twenty days the energetic Coffee stands ready to cataract
      twenty-five thousand of them into South Carolina at the lifting of the
      General's bony finger, and follow these in forty days with twenty-five
      thousand more. Not content with his fifty thousand hunting-shirt men from
      Tennessee, the General arranges for an equal force from North Carolina and
      Georgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever a people stood within the shadow of doom it is our treason-forging
      ones of South Carolina in these days of Nullification, Columbia
      Conventions, Minute Men, and Blue Cockades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them are not so dim of eye but what they perceive as much, and
      begin to catch their breath. Still a wrong, once it be set rolling like a
      stone down hill, is difficult to overtake and stop. So, while the heart of
      would-be Treason beats a little faster, and its cheek turns a little
      whiter, as inklings of what the wordless General is doing begin to creep
      about among Palmetto-rattlesnake coteries, the work of making ready for
      black revolt proceeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Washington, that grim silence of the White House grows oppressive.
      There be prudent ones, among the nullifying adherents of Statesman
      Calhoun, who are willing to play the part of traitor if no peril attend
      the rôle. They are highly averse to the character if it promise to thrust
      their sensitive necks into gallows danger. The questions everywhere on the
      whispering lips of these timid treason mongers are:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the Jackson intention? What will the President do? Will he look
      upon Nullification as merely some minor sin of politics? Or, will he treat
      it as stark treason, and fall back on courts and hangman's ropes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one answers, for no one knows. As for the General himself, his lips are
      as dumb as a statue's. Traitors may go wrong, or go right; he will light
      no lamp for their guidance. The awful suspense is carrying many of the
      treason mongers to the brink of hysteria. Even Statesman Calhoun, morbid
      and ambition-mad, is made to pause. He himself begins to wonder if it
      would not be as well and as wise to measure in advance those iron-bound
      anti-treason lengths to which the General stands ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help them in their perplexity, Statesman
    </p>
    <p>
      Calhoun and his Nullifying followers evolve a cunning scheme. In its
      amiable execution, it should lay bare, they think, the purposes of the
      General. Statesman Calhoun and his coconspirators have long ago laid claim
      to the dead Jefferson as their patron saint of &ldquo;Nullification,&rdquo; asserting
      that precious tenet to be his invention. They decide to give a dinner in
      honor of the departed publicist. The dinner shall take place on the dead
      Jefferson's birthday at the Indian Queen. The General shall come as a
      guest. Statesman Calhoun and his co-conspirators will be there. Statesman
      Calhoun will offer a toast, declaratory of those superior rights over the
      Federal government which he asserts in favor of the separate States. It
      shall be a Nullification toast, one redolent of a State's right to secede
      from the Federal Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun having launched his fireship of sentiment, the General
      will be requested to give a toast. Should he comply, it is believed by
      Statesman Calhoun and his co-conspirators that he will in partial measure
      at least unlock his plans. If he refuse&mdash;why then, under the
      circumstances, his refusal will be pregnant of meaning. In either event,
      he will be beneath the batteries of five hundred eyes, and much should be
      read in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Jefferson dinner is an admirable device, one adapted to draw the
      General's fire. Its authors go about felicitating themselves upon their
      sagacity in evolving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you, Major?&rdquo; asks the General, when he receives the invitation
      upon which so much of national good or ill may pend; &ldquo;what say you? Shall
      we humor them? You know what these Calhoun traitors are after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; responds Wizard Lewis; &ldquo;they want to count us, and measure us, in
      that business of their proposed treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what I think,&rdquo; says the General, after a pause. &ldquo;I'll fail
      to attend; but you shall go, and be counted in my stead. Also, since
      they'll expect a toast from me, I'll send them one in your care. I hope
      they may find it to their villain liking&mdash;they and their archtraitor
      Calhoun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian Queen is a crowded hostelry that Jefferson night. The halls and
      waiting rooms are thronged of eminent folk. Some are there to attend the
      dinner; others for gossip and to hear the news. As Wizard Lewis climbs the
      stairs to the banquet room on the second floor, he encounters the
      lion-faced Webster coming down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's too much secession in the air for me,&rdquo; says the lion-faced one,
      shrugging his heavy shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; returns Wizard Lewis, &ldquo;it's a reason for remaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wizard Lewis mingles with the groups in the corridors and parlors, for the
      banquet hall is not yet thrown open. Among these, he nods his recognition
      of Colonel Johnson, of Kentucky, tall of form, grave of brow, he who slew
      Tecumseh; Senator Benton, once of that safe receptive cellar; the lean
      Rufus Choate, eaten of Federalism and the worship of caste; Tom Corwin,
      round, humorous, with a face of ruddy fun; Isaac Hill, gray and lame, the
      General's Senate friend from New Hampshire whose insulted credit started
      the war on Banker Biddle's bank; Editor Noah, of New York, as Hebraic and
      as red of head as Absalom; the quick-eyed Amos Kendall; Editor Blair, who
      conducts the <i>Globe</i>, the General's mouthpiece in Washington; the
      reckless Marcy, who declares that he sees &ldquo;no harm in the aphorism that
      'to the victor belong the spoils of the enemy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner is spread. The decorations are studied in their democracy.
      Hundreds of candles in many-armed iron branches blaze and gutter about the
      great room. The high ceilings and the walls are festooned of flags. The
      stars and stripes are draped over a portrait of the dead Jefferson. Here
      and there are hung the flags of the several States. With peculiar
      ostentation, and as though for challenge, next to the national colors
      flows the Palmetto-rattlesnake flag of South Carolina&mdash;Statesman
      Calhoun's emblem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner is profuse, and folk of appetite and fineness declare it
      elegant. There is none of your long-drawn courses, so dear to Whigs and
      Federalists. Black servants come and go, to shift plates and knives, and
      carve at the call of a guest. At hopeful intervals along the tables repose
      huge sirloins, and steaming rounds of beef. There are quail pies; chickens
      fried and turkeys roasted; pies of venison and rabbits, and pot pies of
      squirrels; soups and fishes and vegetables; boiled hams, and giant dishes
      of earthenware holding baked beans; roast suckling pigs, each with a
      crab-apple in his jaws; corn breads and flour breads, and pancakes rolled
      with jellies; puddings&mdash;Indian, rice, and plum; mammoth quaking
      custards. Everywhere bristle ranks and double ranks of bottles and
      decanters; a widest range of drinks, from whisky to wine of the Cape, is
      at everybody's elbow. Also on side tables stand wooden bowls of salads,
      supported by weighty cheeses; and, to close in the flanks, pies&mdash;mince,
      pumpkin, and apple; with final coffee and slim, long pipes of clay in
      which to smoke tobacco of Trinidad.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the guests seat themselves, Chairman Lee proposes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The memory of Thomas Jefferson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The toast is drunk in silence. Then, with clatter of knife and fork, clink
      of glasses, and hum of conversation, the feast begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's absence is a daunting surprise to many who do not know how
      to construe it. Wizard Lewis, through Chairman Lee, presents the General's
      regrets. He expected to be present, but is unavoidably detained at the
      White House. The &ldquo;regrets&rdquo; are received uneasily; the General's absence
      plainly gives concern to more than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dinner marches forward, &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; and secession are much and
      loudly talked. They become so openly the burden of conversation and are
      withal so loosely in the common air, that sundry gentlemen&mdash;more
      timorous than loyal perhaps&mdash;make pointless excuses, and withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun sits on the right hand of Chairman Lee. The festival
      approaches the glass and bottle stage, and toasts are offered. There are a
      round score of these; each smells of secession and State's rights. The
      speeches which follow are even more malodorous of treason than the toasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour is hurrying toward the late. Statesman Calhoun whispers a word to
      Chairman Lee; evidently the urgent moment is at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun hands a slip of paper to Chairman Lee. There falls a
      stillness; laughter dies and talk is hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chairman Lee rises to his feet. He pays Statesman Calhoun many flowery
      compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The distinguished statesman from South Carolina,&rdquo; says Chairman Lee in
      conclusion, &ldquo;begs to propose this sentiment.&rdquo; He reads from the slip:
      &ldquo;'The Federal Union! Next to our liberty, the most dear! May we all
      remember that it can only be preserved by respecting the rights of the
      States, and distributing equally the burdens and the benefits of that
      Union!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stillness of death continues&mdash;marked and profound; for, as
      Chairman Lee resumes his seat, Wizard Lewis rises. All know his relations
      with the General; every eye is on him with a look of interrogation. Now
      when the Calhoun toast has been read, they scan the face of Wizard Lewis,
      representative of the absent General, to note the effect of the shot.
      Wizard Lewis is admirable, and notably steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The President,&rdquo; says Wizard Lewis, &ldquo;when he sent his regrets, sent also a
      sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wizard Lewis passes a folded paper to Chairman Lee, who opens it and
      reads:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The Federal Union! It must be preserved!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      The words fall clear as a bell&mdash;for some, perhaps, a bell of warning.
      Statesman Calhoun's face is high and insolent. But only for a moment. Then
      his glance falls; his brow becomes pallid, and breaks into a pin-point
      sprinkle of sweat. He seems to shrink and sear and wither, as though given
      some fleeting picture of the future, and the gallows prophecy thereof. In
      the end he sits as though in a kind of blackness of despair. The General
      is not there, but his words are there, and Statesman Calhoun is not
      wanting of an impression of the terrible meaning, personal to himself,
      which underlies them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a moment ominous and mighty&mdash;a moment when a plot to stampede
      history is foiled by a sentiment, and Treason's heart and Treason's hand
      are palsied by a toast of seven words. And while Statesman Calhoun, white
      and frightened and broken, is helpless in the midst of his followers, the
      General sits alone and thoughtful with his quiet White House pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all the plain sureness of that toast, the would-be rebellionists now
      crave a surer sign. A member of Congress from South Carolina, polite and
      insinuating, calls on the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. President,&rdquo; says the insinuating signseeking one, suavely
      deferential, &ldquo;to-morrow I go back to my home. Have you any message for the
      good folk of South Carolina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returns the General grimly, his hard blue eyes upon the insinuating
      one, while his heavy brows are lowered in that falcon-trick of menace&mdash;&ldquo;yes;
      I have a message for the 'good folk of South Carolina.' You may say to the
      'good folk of South Carolina' that if one of them so much as lift finger
      in defiance of the laws of this government, I shall come down there. And
      I'll hang the first man I lay hands on, to the first tree I can reach.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;THE ROUT OF TREASON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>EMOCRACY goes not
      without its defects, and there be times when that very freedom wherewith
      it invests the citizen spreads a snare to his feet. For a chief fault,
      Democracy is apt to mislead ambitious ones, dominated of ego and a want of
      patriotism in even parts. Such are prone to run liberty into license in
      following forth the appetites of their own selfishness, and forget where
      the frontiers of loyalty leave off and those of black treason begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a democracy, for your clambering narrowist to turn traitor is never a
      far-fetched task. Being free to speak as he politically will and, per
      incident, think as he politically will, he finds it no mighty journey to
      the perilous assumption that he may act as he politically will. Knowing
      his duty to guard the temple, he argues therefrom his right to deface it.
      Treason fades into a mere abstraction&mdash;a crime curious in this, that
      it is impossible of concrete commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun is among these ill-guided ones of topsy-turvy
      patriotism. Blurred by ambition, soured of disappointment, license and
      liberty have grown with him to be unconscious synonyms. The laws against
      treason carry only a remonstrance, never a warning, and&mdash;as he reads
      them&mdash;but deplore that civic villainy, while threatening nothing of
      grief for what dark souls shall be guilty of it. In this frame the
      General's stark sentiment, &ldquo;The Federal Union! It must be preserved!&rdquo; and
      that subsequent hanging promise which, by the mouth of the suave
      insinuating one, he sends to &ldquo;the good folk of South Carolina,&rdquo; go beyond
      surprise with Statesman Calhoun, and provide a shock. It is as though,
      walking in a trance of treason, he knocks his head against the White House
      wall; his awakening is rudely, painfully complete. That dream of a
      separate nation, with himself at its head, gives way to hangman visions of
      rope and gallows tree; and, from bending his energies to methods by which
      he may take South Carolina out of the Union, he gives himself wholly to
      the more tremulous enterprise of keeping himself out of jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hint of that recent literature, which the General found so
      interesting, gets abroad, and many go reading the lucid dictum of old
      Marshall. Treason as a crime becomes better understood; and&mdash;by
      Statesman Calhoun at least&mdash;better feared. Moved of these fears,
      Statesman Calhoun sends message after message into his restless
      Palmetto-rattlesnake State of South Carolina commanding, nay imploring, a
      present suspension of &ldquo;Nullification.&rdquo; His Palmetto-rattlesnake adherents,
      while not understanding the danger which fringes them about, have already
      found enough that is alarming in the very air; and, for their own safety
      as much as his, are heedful to regard that prayer for a &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo;
       passivity. The South Carolina shouting ceases; the Minute Men rest on
      their traitorous arms; the manufacture of blue cockades is abandoned;
      while the Columbia convention devotes itself to innocuous adjournments
      from innocent day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Palmetto-rattlesnake affairs are thus timidly quiescent, the Senate
      itself&mdash;having read old Marshall, and being, moreover, somewhat
      instructed by the watchful attitude of the General, who sits in the White
      House a figure of frowning menace, both relentless and fateful&mdash;devotes
      itself to the scaffold extrication of Statesman Calhoun. Machiavelli Clay
      leads the rescue party. His is of an opposite political church to that of
      Statesman Calhoun; but the pair meet on the warm, common ground of a
      deathless hatred of the General. Under the mollifying guidance of
      Machiavelli Clay, Senator after Senator surrenders those pet schedules of
      tariff desired of his own people, and puts the surrender on the expressive
      basis of &ldquo;saving the neck of Calhoun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When every possible tariff cut has been arranged, and Congress adjourns,
      Statesman Calhoun makes his memorable homeward flight. Horse after horse
      he rides down, night becomes as day; for Death crouches on his crupper,
      and he must stay the Nullifying hand of South Carolina to save his own
      neck. He succeeds beyond his deserts, and comes powdering into Columbia,
      worn and wan and anxious, yet none the less ahead of that &ldquo;overt act&rdquo;
       whereof old Marshall spoke, and for which the somber General waits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once among his own treason-hatching coterie, Statesman Calhoun loses no
      moments, but breaks up the &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; nest. Secession dies in the
      shell, and the Columbia convention, with more speed even than it displayed
      in passing it, repeals that &ldquo;Ordinance of Nullification.&rdquo; Thereupon
      Statesman Calhoun draws his breath more freely, as one who has been grazed
      by the sinister fangs of Fate; while the inveterate General heaves a sigh
      of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wizard Lewis overhears the sigh, and questions it. At this the General
      explains his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been better,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;had we shed a little blood. This is
      not the end, Major; the serpent of treason is only bruised, not slain. Had
      Calhoun run his course, a handful of hundreds might have died. As affairs
      stand, however, the country must one day wade knee-deep in blood to save
      itself. These men are not honest. Their true purpose is the downfall of
      the Union. Their present pretext is tariff; next time it will be slavery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By way of bringing the iniquity of &ldquo;Nullification&rdquo; before the people,
      together with his views concerning it, the General seizes his big iron
      pen, and scratches off a proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the power to annul a law of the United States,
      assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union,
      contradicted expressly by the Constitution, unauthorized by either its
      letter or its spirit, inconsistent with every principle upon which it was
      founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The country, reading the General's exposition of the Union and its
      Gibraltar-like character, breaks into bonfires, oratory, dinners,
      barbecues, parades, and what other schemes of jubilation are practiced by
      a free people. That is to say the country breaks into these sundry
      jubilant things, if one except the truant State of South Carolina. In that
      Palmetto-rattlesnake-ridden commonwealth there prevails a sulky silence.
      No bonfires blaze, no barbecues scorch, no dinners smoke, no parades
      march. Baffled in its would-be treasons, afraid to stretch forth its
      nullifying hand lest the sword of retribution strike it off at the wrist,
      it comports itself like a spoiled child thwarted, and upholds its little
      dignity with a pout. No one heeds, however; and, beyond an occasional
      baleful glance from the General, the rest of the world leaves it to
      recover from that pout in its own time and way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Congress reconvenes, Statesman Calhoun creeps back to his Senate
      place. But the perils through which he has passed have left their
      furrowing traces, and now he offers nothing, says nothing, does nothing.
      His heart is water; his evil potentialities have oozed away. Haunted of
      that hangman fear which still hag-rides him, he abides mute, motionless,
      impotent, like some Satan in chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      To further wound Statesman Calhoun, and in the mean, protesting teeth of
      Machiavelli Clay, the Senate expunges from its record the vote of censure
      it once passed upon the General. The resolution to expunge is offered by
      Senator Benton who, as against a far-off Nashville hour when only a
      generous cellar saved him from the General's saw-handle, is to-day the
      latter's partisan and friend. The General is hugely pleased by the
      censure-expunging resolution, and has what Senate ones supported it&mdash;being
      fairly the whole Senate, when one forgets Machiavelli Clay, and our
      chained, embittered Satan, Statesman Calhoun&mdash;to a grand dinner in
      the East Room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the official times wag prosperously with the General. His friends
      are everywhere dominant, his enemies everywhere in retreat. Also his hair,
      from iron gray, fades to milk-white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since nothing peculiar presses upon him in the way of opposition, the
      General falls ill. He makes little of this, however; and cures himself
      with tobacco, coffee, calomel, and lancets, while outraged doctors groan.
      Likewise, he burns midnight oil in planning with Wizard Lewis the
      elevation of Vice-President Van Buren, who he is resolved shall have the
      presidency after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus the General lays his Van Buren plans, misguided admirers
      bombard him with such marks of their regard as a phaëton built of unbarked
      hickory, and a cheese weighing fourteen hundred pounds. The latter sturdy
      confection is trundled into the White House kitchen, from which coign of
      vantage it sends on high a perfume so utterly urgent that none may stay in
      the White House until it is removed. Following its going, the executive
      windows are thrown open throughout a wind-swept afternoon, to the end that
      the last suffocating reminder of that cheese shall be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General's hours as President are drawing to a close. His hopes
      touching a successor carry through triumphantly, and Vice-President Van
      Buren is selected to follow him. Neither Machiavelli Clay for the Whigs,
      nor Statesman Calhoun among the Democrats, has the courage to offer his
      own name to the people.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Statesman Calhoun, aiming to subtract as much as he may from the fortunes
      of nominee Van Buren, produces a bolting ticket, headed by one Mangum;
      and, for Mangum, Palmetto-rattlesnake South Carolina&mdash;still in a
      tearful pout&mdash;wastes its lonely arrow in the air. It was, it will be,
      ever thus with South Carolina, who might do herself a good, and come to
      some true notion of her own peevish inconsequence, if she would but take a
      long, hard look in the glass. She is as one who attends the fairs, but so
      over-esteems herself as to defeat every bargain she might make. Her best
      chances are cast away, a cheap sacrifice to vanity, since no one will
      either buy her or sell her at the figure she sets on herself. Thus, too,
      will it continue. Her frayed prospects, already behind a fashion, are to
      wax more shopworn and more threadbare as the years unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nominee Van Buren is elected to succeed the General in the White House,
      and every friend of the latter votes for the little polite man of
      Kinderhook. The General is delighted, since the elevation of nominee Van
      Buren provides for a continuation of his darling policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wizard Lewis is delighted, because the new situation permits the return of
      himself and his beloved General to their homes by the Cumberland. Nor does
      it detract from the satisfaction of either that, with the presidential
      coming of the Kinderhook one, the final door of political hope is barred
      fast in the faces of Machiavelli Clay and Statesman Calhoun; for both the
      General and Wizard Lewis hate these two as though that hatred were a
      religious rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last dawns President Van Buren's inauguration morning, and the General
      stands for the last time before a people whose good and whose honor he has
      so jealously guarded. Of this farewell appearance, poet Willis writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The air was elastic; the day bright and still. More than twenty
      thousand people had assembled. The procession, the General and Mr. Van
      Buren riding uncovered, arrived a little after noon. Their carriage, drawn
      by four grays, paused. Descending from it at the foot of the steps, a
      passage was made through the crowd, and the tall white head of the old
      chieftain went steadily up. The crowd of diplomats and senators to the
      rear gave way. A murmur of feeling rose up from the moving mass below, as
      the infirm old General, coming as he had from a sick chamber which his
      physicians had thought it impossible he should leave, stood bowed before
      the people</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his address the General touches many things. He closes by saying: &ldquo;My
      own race is nearly run. Advanced age and failing health warn me that I
      must soon pass beyond the reach of human events. I thank God my life has
      been spent in a land of liberty, and that He gave me a heart wherewith to
      love my country. Filled with gratitude, I bid you farewell.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;THE GRAVE AT THE GARDEN'S FOOT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE General wends
      his slow way homeward, and is two months about the journey. His progress,
      broken by many stops, is like both a triumph and a funeral; for double
      ranks of worshipers line the route and sob or cheer as he passes. The
      harsh horse-face is seamed of care and worn by sickness; but the slim form
      is still erect and lance-like, and the blue eyes gleam as hawkishly
      dangerous as when, behind his low mud walls with the faithful Coffee and
      his hunting-shirt men, he broke down England's pride at New Orleans.
      Everywhere the people press about him; for republics are not ungrateful,
      and for once in a way of politics it is the setting, not the rising sun
      upon which all eyes are centered. In the end he reaches home, and his
      country of the Cumberland, as on many a former day, opens its arms to
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the General, for all his sickness and his well-nigh threescore
      years and ten, must bend himself to his labors as a planter; for he has
      come back very poor. He has his acres and his slaves; but debts have piled
      themselves high, and the tooth of decay can do a devastating deal in eight
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General goes to work as though life is just begun. The fences are
      renewed, the buildings repaired, while the plow breaks fresh furrows in
      fields that have lain fallow too long. To finance his plans, he borrows
      ten thousand dollars from Editor Blair. Later, by a huddle of months,
      Congress repays him that one-thousand-dollar fine, of which a quarter of a
      century before he was mulcted in New Orleans. This latter, interest
      swollen, is twenty-seven hundred dollars&mdash;a sum not treated lightly
      in this hour of his narrowed fortunes!
    </p>
    <p>
      All goes prosperously. The generous soil, as though for welcome to the
      General, grants such crops of cotton that the wondering Cumberland folk,
      as once they did aforetime, come miles to view his fields. When not busy
      with his planting, the General is immersed in politics. Each day he rides
      down to Wizard Lewis four miles below; or Wizard Lewis rides those four
      miles up to the Hermitage. Being together, the pair, over pipe and
      moderate glass, sagely consider the state of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down by the General's gate is a large-stomached mail box. Each morning
      finds it stuffed to suffocation with sheaves of letters and papers tied in
      bundles. Also there are shoals and shoals of visitors. For the General's
      home is a Mecca of politics, to which pilgrims of party turn their steps
      by ones and twos and tens. Some come to do the stark old General honor;
      some are one-time comrades, or friends who rose up around him on fields of
      party war. For the most, however, and because humanity is selfish before
      it is either just or generous, the visitors are office-seeking folk, who
      ask the magic of the General's signature to their appeals.
    </p>
    <p>
      These selfish ones become, in their vermin number and persistency, a very
      plague. They wring from the suffering General the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good book, Major,&rdquo; says he to Wizard Lewis, &ldquo;tells us that at the
      beginning there were in Eden a man, a woman, and an office seeker who had
      been kicked out of heaven for preaching 'Nullification' I To judge of the
      visiting procession, as it streams in and out of my front gate, I should
      say that the latter in his descendants has increased and multiplied far
      beyond the other two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The French king forgets and forgives those grievous five millions, and
      dispatches an artist of celebration to paint the General's portrait. The
      artist finds the latter of a mind to humor the French king. The portrait
      is painted&mdash;a striking likeness!&mdash;and the gratified artist
      carries it victoriously across seas to his royal master.

      <a href="images/0365.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The General becomes concerned in keeping England from stealing Oregon, and
      writes letters to the Government at Washington in protest against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oregon or war!&rdquo; is his counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as deeply does he involve himself for the admission of Texas into the
      Union, declaring that of right the nation's boundary should be, and, save
      for the criminal carelessness of Statesman Adams on the occasion of the
      last treaty with Spain&mdash;made in a Monroe hour&mdash;would be, the Rio
      Grande. Statesman Adams, now in his icy old age, makes a speech in Boston
      and denies this; whereat the General retorts in an open letter that
      Statesman Adams is &ldquo;a monarchist in disguise,&rdquo; a &ldquo;traitor,&rdquo; a &ldquo;falsifier,&rdquo;
       and his &ldquo;entire address full of statements at war with truth, and
      sentiments hostile to every dictate of patriotism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Machiavelli Clay foolishly invades the Cumberland country on a broad
      mission of personal politics, and he like Statesman Adams makes a speech.
      Machiavelli Clay, however, does not talk of Oregon, or Texas, or what
      shall be the nation's foreign policy, whether timid or warlike. His is
      wholly and solely a party oration, and in it he pays left-handed tribute
      to Aaron Burr, dead a decade. Machiavelli Clay escapes no better with his
      offensive eloquence than does Statesman Adams. The perilous old General
      from his Hermitage is instantly out upon him with another open letter, of
      which the closing paragraph says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>How contemptible does this lying demagogue appear, when he descends
      from his high place in the Senate, and roams over the country retailing
      slanders against the dead</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General is much refreshed by these outbursts, and, in that contentment
      of soul which follows, resolves to join the church. Long ago he promised
      the blooming Rachel, fast asleep at the foot of the garden, that once he
      be free from the muddy yoke of politics he will accept religion, and now
      he keeps his word. He unites himself with the congregation which worships
      in that little chapel, aforetime built for the blooming Rachel, and, upon
      his coming into the fold, there arises vast rejoicing throughout the
      ardent length and breadth of Cumberland Presbyterianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pastor, Dominie Edgar, calls often at the Hermitage; for he feels that
      the General may require some special spiritual grooming. One day he
      observes that convert's saw-handles, oiled and neat and ready for blood,
      on a mantel, prayerfully crossed beneath a portrait of the blooming
      Rachel. The good dominie is shocked, but does not show it. He picks up one
      of the saw-handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has seen service, doubtless,&rdquo; he remarks tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; responds the General grimly; &ldquo;it has seen good service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dominie Edgar puts the saw-handle back in place, and his curiosity pushes
      no farther afield. He rightly conjectures it to be the weapon which cut
      down the slanderous Dickinson, and mentally holds that it will more
      advantage the soul of his convert to touch as scantily as may be upon
      topics so ferocious. Shifting his ground, Dominie Edgar asks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, do you forgive your enemies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parson,&rdquo; says the convert, &ldquo;I forgive <i>my</i> enemies, and welcome. But
      I shall never&rdquo;&mdash;here he points up at the portrait of the blooming
      Rachel, which seems to lovingly follow his every motion with its painted
      patient eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I shall never forgive <i>her</i> enemies. My feud
      shall follow them, and the memory of them, to the end of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dominie Edgar sits down with his convert to show him the error of his
      obdurate ways. He lectures cogently. It is to be feared, however, that his
      doctrinal seed of forgiveness falls upon hard, intractable ground; for,
      while the convert says never a word, the lecture serves but to light again
      in those blue eyes what lamps of hateful battle burned there on a certain
      fierce May morning in that popular Kentucky wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long days come and go, and the General lives on in fortune, peace, and
      honor. Then the end draws down; for the General has run his threescore
      years and ten, and well-nigh ten years more. Wizard Lewis sits by his
      bedside, and never leaves him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go, Major,&rdquo; murmurs the General to Wizard Lewis; &ldquo;for she is
      over there.&rdquo; He raises his eyes to the portrait of the blooming Rachel,
      and looks upon it long and lovingly. &ldquo;Major!&rdquo;&mdash;Wizard Lewis presses
      the thin hand&mdash;&ldquo;see that they make my grave by her side at the
      garden's foot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General drifts into a stupor, Wizard Lewis holding fast his hand. The
      good dominie Edgar is on his knees at prayer. From the porch outside the
      sick room are heard the sobs and moans of the mourning blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wizard Lewis attempts to recall the dying General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have done with Calhoun,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;had he persisted in his
      'Nullification' designs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blue eyes rouse, and sparkle and glance with old-time fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would I have done with Calhoun?&rdquo; repeats the General, his voice
      renewed and strong; &ldquo;Hanged him, sir!&mdash;hanged him as high as Haman!
      He should have been a warning to traitors for all time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sparkle subsides; the blue eyes close again in the dullness of coming
      death. Wizard Lewis holds the poor thin hand, while Dominie Edgar prays on
      to the accompaniment of the sobbing and the moaning of the sorrowing
      blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prayer ends; the good dominie rises to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know me, General?&rdquo; he whispers. The dim eyes are lifted to those
      of Dominie Edgar. The latter goes on: &ldquo;The love of the Lord is infinite!
      In it you shall find heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General turns with looks of love to the portrait of the blooming
      Rachel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parson,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I must meet her there, or it will be no heaven for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General's head droops heavily forward. Dominie Edgar falls upon his
      knees, and the voice of his praying goes upward with the moaning and the
      sobbing of the slaves. Wizard Lewis places his hand on the General's
      breast. He sighs, and shakes his head. That mighty heart, all love, all
      iron, is still.

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
